**WARNING: Please, read this note carefully before submitting a new issue:**

It is important to realise that **this is NOT A SUPPORT FORUM**, this is for reproducible BUGS with raylib ONLY.

There are lots of generous and helpful people ready to help you out on [raylib Discord forum](https://discord.gg/raylib) or [raylib reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib/).

Remember that asking for support questions here actively takes developer time away from improving raylib.

Please, before submitting a new issue verify and check:

 - [ ] I tested it on latest raylib version from master branch
 - [ ] I checked there is no similar issue already reported
 - [ ] I checked the documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki)
 - [ ] My code has no errors or misuse of raylib

### Issue description

### Environment

*Provide your Platform, Operating System, OpenGL version, GPU details where you experienced the issue.*

### Issue Screenshot
