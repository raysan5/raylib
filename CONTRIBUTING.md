### raylib philosophy

 - raylib is a tool to **ENJOY** videogames programming, every function in raylib is designed as a mini-tutorial on itself.
 - raylib is **SIMPLE** and **EASY-TO-USE**, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex, better not including it.
 - raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to **TEACH** videogames programming completely for free.
 - raylib is collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code examples / bug fixes / code comments are highly appreciated.
 - raylib's license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using raylib on commercial projects.

### Some interesting reads to start with

 - [raylib history](HISTORY.md)
 - [raylib architecture](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-architecture)
 - [raylib license](LICENSE)
 - [raylib roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
 
[raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki) contains some information about the library and is open to anyone to edit. 
Feel free to review it if required, just take care not to break something.

### raylib C coding conventions

Despite being written in C, raylib does not follow the standard Hungarian notation for C, 
it [follows Pascal-case/camel-case notation](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-coding-conventions), 
more common in C# language. All code formatting decisions have been carefully taken
to make it easier for students/users to read, write and understand code.

Source code is extensively commented for that purpose, raylib primary learning method is:

 > `Learn by reading code and examples`

For detailed information on building raylib and examples, please check [raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki).

### Opening new Issues

To open new issues for raylib (bug, enhancement, discussion...), just try to follow these rules:

 - Make sure the issue has not already been reported before by searching on GitHub under Issues.
 - If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a 
 title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
 - If applicable, attach some screenshot of the issue and a .zip file with the code sample and required resources.
 - On issue description, add a brackets tag about the raylib module that relates to this issue. 
 If don't know which module, just report the issue, I will review it.
 - You can check other issues to see how is being done!

### Sending a Pull-Request

 - Make sure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
 - Don't send big pull requests (lots of changelists), they are difficult to review. It's better to send small pull requests, one at a time.
 - Verify that changes don't break the build (at least on Windows platform). The more platforms where you can test it, the better, but don't worry
 if you cannot test all the platforms.
