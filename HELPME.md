help me!
========

I’m working hard on raylib but my resources are quite limited. If you enjoy raylib and want to help / contribute in some way, 
please, [let me know][raysan5].

The following help is highly appreciated:

	- C programming - Can you write / review / test / improve the code? 
	- Translators / Localizators - Can you translate raylib to another language?
	- Documentation / Tutorials / Example writters - Can you write some tutorial / example?
	- Web Development (I need a lot of help with this...) - Can you help with the web?
	- Porting to Linux and OSX - Can you compile and test raylib on another OS?
	- Testers of current features and multiple systems - Can you find some bug on raylib?

If you can not help on any of the above points but you still want to contribute in some way... please, consider helping 
with a small donation (just some euros...). It will really motivate to continue improving this project (and pay some bills… or some coffee).

raylib philosophy
------------------

   * raylib is a tool to LEARN videogames programming, every single function in raylib should be a tutorial on itself.
   * raylib is SIMPLE and EASY-TO-USE, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex or 
	 has not a clear usefulness, better not to include it.
   * raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to TEACH videogames programming completely by free. 
   * raylib is, hopefully, collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code-examples / bugs-solving / code-comments are highly appreciated.
   * raylib's license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using it for commercial products.
