**raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.**

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

*NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.*

basic example
--------------
This is a basic raylib example, it creates a window and draws the text `"Congrats! You created your first window!"` in the middle of the screen. Check this example [running live on web here](https://www.raylib.com/examples/core/loader.html?name=core_basic_window).
```c
#include "raylib.h"

int main(void)
{
    InitWindow(800, 450, "raylib [core] example - basic window");

    while (!WindowShouldClose())
    {
        BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
            DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);
        EndDrawing();
    }

    CloseWindow();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Setup raylib with multiple IDEs

raylib has been developed on Windows platform using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [MinGW GCC](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) compiler but it can be used with other IDEs on multiple platforms.

[Projects directory](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/projects) contains several ready-to-use **project templates** to build raylib and code examples with multiple IDEs.

*Note that there are lots of IDEs supported, some of the provided templates could require some review, so please, if you find some issue with a template or you think they could be improved, feel free to send a PR or open a related issue.*

learning and docs
------------------

raylib is designed to be learned using [the examples](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/examples) as the main reference. There is no standard API documentation but there is a [**cheatsheet**](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) containing all the functions available on the library a short description of each one of them, input parameters and result value names should be intuitive enough to understand how each function works. 

Some additional documentation about raylib design can be found in [raylib GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki). Here are the relevant links:
