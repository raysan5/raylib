1. Introduction
===============
miniaudio is a single file library for audio playback and capture. To use it, do the following in one .c file:

    ```c
    #define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "miniaudio.h"
    ```

You can do `#include "miniaudio.h"` in other parts of the program just like any other header.

miniaudio uses the concept of a "device" as the abstraction for physical devices. The idea is that you choose a physical device to emit or capture audio from,
and then move data to/from the device when miniaudio tells you to. Data is delivered to and from devices asynchronously via a callback which you specify when
initializing the device.

When initializing the device you first need to configure it. The device configuration allows you to specify things like the format of the data delivered via
the callback, the size of the internal buffer and the ID of the device you want to emit or capture audio from.

Once you have the device configuration set up you can initialize the device. When initializing a device you need to allocate memory for the device object
beforehand. This gives the application complete control over how the memory is allocated. In the example below we initialize a playback device on the stack,
but you could allocate it on the heap if that suits your situation better.

    ```c
    void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount)
    {
        // In playback mode copy data to pOutput. In capture mode read data from pInput. In full-duplex mode, both
        // pOutput and pInput will be valid and you can move data from pInput into pOutput. Never process more than
        // frameCount frames.
    }

    int main()
    {
        ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
        config.playback.format   = ma_format_f32;   // Set to ma_format_unknown to use the device's native format.
        config.playback.channels = 2;               // Set to 0 to use the device's native channel count.
        config.sampleRate        = 48000;           // Set to 0 to use the device's native sample rate.
        config.dataCallback      = data_callback;   // This function will be called when miniaudio needs more data.
        config.pUserData         = pMyCustomData;   // Can be accessed from the device object (device.pUserData).

        ma_device device;
        if (ma_device_init(NULL, &config, &device) != MA_SUCCESS) {
            return -1;  // Failed to initialize the device.
        }

        ma_device_start(&device);     // The device is sleeping by default so you'll need to start it manually.

        // Do something here. Probably your program's main loop.

        ma_device_uninit(&device);    // This will stop the device so no need to do that manually.
        return 0;
    }
    ```

In the example above, `data_callback()` is where audio data is written and read from the device. The idea is in playback mode you cause sound to be emitted
from the speakers by writing audio data to the output buffer (`pOutput` in the example). In capture mode you read data from the input buffer (`pInput`) to
extract sound captured by the microphone. The `frameCount` parameter tells you how many frames can be written to the output buffer and read from the input
buffer. A "frame" is one sample for each channel. For example, in a stereo stream (2 channels), one frame is 2 samples: one for the left, one for the right.
The channel count is defined by the device config. The size in bytes of an individual sample is defined by the sample format which is also specified in the
device config. Multi-channel audio data is always interleaved, which means the samples for each frame are stored next to each other in memory. For example, in
a stereo stream the first pair of samples will be the left and right samples for the first frame, the second pair of samples will be the left and right samples
for the second frame, etc.

The configuration of the device is defined by the `ma_device_config` structure. The config object is always initialized with `ma_device_config_init()`. It's
important to always initialize the config with this function as it initializes it with logical defaults and ensures your program doesn't break when new members
are added to the `ma_device_config` structure. The example above uses a fairly simple and standard device configuration. The call to `ma_device_config_init()`
takes a single parameter, which is whether or not the device is a playback, capture, duplex or loopback device (loopback devices are not supported on all
backends). The `config.playback.format` member sets the sample format which can be one of the following (all formats are native-endian):

    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Symbol        | Description                            | Range                     |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
    | ma_format_f32 | 32-bit floating point                  | [-1, 1]                   |
    | ma_format_s16 | 16-bit signed integer                  | [-32768, 32767]           |
    | ma_format_s24 | 24-bit signed integer (tightly packed) | [-8388608, 8388607]       |
    | ma_format_s32 | 32-bit signed integer                  | [-2147483648, 2147483647] |
    | ma_format_u8  | 8-bit unsigned integer                 | [0, 255]                  |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+

The `config.playback.channels` member sets the number of channels to use with the device. The channel count cannot exceed MA_MAX_CHANNELS. The
`config.sampleRate` member sets the sample rate (which must be the same for both playback and capture in full-duplex configurations). This is usually set to
44100 or 48000, but can be set to anything. It's recommended to keep this between 8000 and 384000, however.

Note that leaving the format, channel count and/or sample rate at their default values will result in the internal device's native configuration being used
which is useful if you want to avoid the overhead of miniaudio's automatic data conversion.

In addition to the sample format, channel count and sample rate, the data callback and user data pointer are also set via the config. The user data pointer is
not passed into the callback as a parameter, but is instead set to the `pUserData` member of `ma_device` which you can access directly since all miniaudio
structures are transparent.

Initializing the device is done with `ma_device_init()`. This will return a result code telling you what went wrong, if anything. On success it will return
`MA_SUCCESS`. After initialization is complete the device will be in a stopped state. To start it, use `ma_device_start()`. Uninitializing the device will stop
it, which is what the example above does, but you can also stop the device with `ma_device_stop()`. To resume the device simply call `ma_device_start()` again.
Note that it's important to never stop or start the device from inside the callback. This will result in a deadlock. Instead you set a variable or signal an
event indicating that the device needs to stop and handle it in a different thread. The following APIs must never be called inside the callback:

    ```c
    ma_device_init()
    ma_device_init_ex()
    ma_device_uninit()
    ma_device_start()
    ma_device_stop()
    ```

You must never try uninitializing and reinitializing a device inside the callback. You must also never try to stop and start it from inside the callback. There
are a few other things you shouldn't do in the callback depending on your requirements, however this isn't so much a thread-safety thing, but rather a
real-time processing thing which is beyond the scope of this introduction.

The example above demonstrates the initialization of a playback device, but it works exactly the same for capture. All you need to do is change the device type
from `ma_device_type_playback` to `ma_device_type_capture` when setting up the config, like so:

    ```c
    ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_capture);
    config.capture.format   = MY_FORMAT;
    config.capture.channels = MY_CHANNEL_COUNT;
    ```

In the data callback you just read from the input buffer (`pInput` in the example above) and leave the output buffer alone (it will be set to NULL when the
device type is set to `ma_device_type_capture`).

These are the available device types and how you should handle the buffers in the callback:

    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
    | Device Type             | Callback Behavior                                      |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
    | ma_device_type_playback | Write to output buffer, leave input buffer untouched.  |
    | ma_device_type_capture  | Read from input buffer, leave output buffer untouched. |
    | ma_device_type_duplex   | Read from input buffer, write to output buffer.        |
    | ma_device_type_loopback | Read from input buffer, leave output buffer untouched. |
    +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

You will notice in the example above that the sample format and channel count is specified separately for playback and capture. This is to support different
data formats between the playback and capture devices in a full-duplex system. An example may be that you want to capture audio data as a monaural stream (one
channel), but output sound to a stereo speaker system. Note that if you use different formats between playback and capture in a full-duplex configuration you
will need to convert the data yourself. There are functions available to help you do this which will be explained later.

The example above did not specify a physical device to connect to which means it will use the operating system's default device. If you have multiple physical
devices connected and you want to use a specific one you will need to specify the device ID in the configuration, like so:

    ```c
    config.playback.pDeviceID = pMyPlaybackDeviceID;    // Only if requesting a playback or duplex device.
    config.capture.pDeviceID = pMyCaptureDeviceID;      // Only if requesting a capture, duplex or loopback device.
    ```

To retrieve the device ID you will need to perform device enumeration, however this requires the use of a new concept called the "context". Conceptually
speaking the context sits above the device. There is one context to many devices. The purpose of the context is to represent the backend at a more global level
and to perform operations outside the scope of an individual device. Mainly it is used for performing run-time linking against backend libraries, initializing
backends and enumerating devices. The example below shows how to enumerate devices.

    ```c
    ma_context context;
    if (ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context) != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ma_device_info* pPlaybackInfos;
    ma_uint32 playbackCount;
    ma_device_info* pCaptureInfos;
    ma_uint32 captureCount;
    if (ma_context_get_devices(&context, &pPlaybackInfos, &playbackCount, &pCaptureInfos, &captureCount) != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    // Loop over each device info and do something with it. Here we just print the name with their index. You may want
    // to give the user the opportunity to choose which device they'd prefer.
    for (ma_uint32 iDevice = 0; iDevice < playbackCount; iDevice += 1) {
        printf("%d - %s\n", iDevice, pPlaybackInfos[iDevice].name);
    }

    ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
    config.playback.pDeviceID = &pPlaybackInfos[chosenPlaybackDeviceIndex].id;
    config.playback.format    = MY_FORMAT;
    config.playback.channels  = MY_CHANNEL_COUNT;
    config.sampleRate         = MY_SAMPLE_RATE;
    config.dataCallback       = data_callback;
    config.pUserData          = pMyCustomData;

    ma_device device;
    if (ma_device_init(&context, &config, &device) != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error
    }

    ...

    ma_device_uninit(&device);
    ma_context_uninit(&context);
    ```

The first thing we do in this example is initialize a `ma_context` object with `ma_context_init()`. The first parameter is a pointer to a list of `ma_backend`
values which are used to override the default backend priorities. When this is NULL, as in this example, miniaudio's default priorities are used. The second
parameter is the number of backends listed in the array pointed to by the first parameter. The third parameter is a pointer to a `ma_context_config` object
which can be NULL, in which case defaults are used. The context configuration is used for setting the logging callback, custom memory allocation callbacks,
user-defined data and some backend-specific configurations.

Once the context has been initialized you can enumerate devices. In the example above we use the simpler `ma_context_get_devices()`, however you can also use a
callback for handling devices by using `ma_context_enumerate_devices()`. When using `ma_context_get_devices()` you provide a pointer to a pointer that will,
upon output, be set to a pointer to a buffer containing a list of `ma_device_info` structures. You also provide a pointer to an unsigned integer that will
receive the number of items in the returned buffer. Do not free the returned buffers as their memory is managed internally by miniaudio.

The `ma_device_info` structure contains an `id` member which is the ID you pass to the device config. It also contains the name of the device which is useful
for presenting a list of devices to the user via the UI.

When creating your own context you will want to pass it to `ma_device_init()` when initializing the device. Passing in NULL, like we do in the first example,
will result in miniaudio creating the context for you, which you don't want to do since you've already created a context. Note that internally the context is
only tracked by it's pointer which means you must not change the location of the `ma_context` object. If this is an issue, consider using `malloc()` to
allocate memory for the context.



2. Building
===========
miniaudio should work cleanly out of the box without the need to download or install any dependencies. See below for platform-specific details.


2.1. Windows
------------
The Windows build should compile cleanly on all popular compilers without the need to configure any include paths nor link to any libraries.

2.2. macOS and iOS
------------------
The macOS build should compile cleanly without the need to download any dependencies nor link to any libraries or frameworks. The iOS build needs to be
compiled as Objective-C and will need to link the relevant frameworks but should compile cleanly out of the box with Xcode. Compiling through the command line
requires linking to `-lpthread` and `-lm`.

2.3. Linux
----------
The Linux build only requires linking to `-ldl`, `-lpthread` and `-lm`. You do not need any development packages.

2.4. BSD
--------
The BSD build only requires linking to `-lpthread` and `-lm`. NetBSD uses audio(4), OpenBSD uses sndio and FreeBSD uses OSS.

2.5. Android
------------
AAudio is the highest priority backend on Android. This should work out of the box without needing any kind of compiler configuration. Support for AAudio
starts with Android 8 which means older versions will fall back to OpenSL|ES which requires API level 16+.

2.6. Emscripten
---------------
The Emscripten build emits Web Audio JavaScript directly and should compile cleanly out of the box. You cannot use -std=c* compiler flags, nor -ansi.


2.7. Build Options
------------------
`#define` these options before including miniaudio.h.

3. Definitions
==============
This section defines common terms used throughout miniaudio. Unfortunately there is often ambiguity in the use of terms throughout the audio space, so this
section is intended to clarify how miniaudio uses each term.

3.1. Sample
-----------
A sample is a single unit of audio data. If the sample format is f32, then one sample is one 32-bit floating point number.

3.2. Frame / PCM Frame
----------------------
A frame is a group of samples equal to the number of channels. For a stereo stream a frame is 2 samples, a mono frame is 1 sample, a 5.1 surround sound frame
is 6 samples, etc. The terms "frame" and "PCM frame" are the same thing in miniaudio. Note that this is different to a compressed frame. If ever miniaudio
needs to refer to a compressed frame, such as a FLAC frame, it will always clarify what it's referring to with something like "FLAC frame".

3.3. Channel
------------
A stream of monaural audio that is emitted from an individual speaker in a speaker system, or received from an individual microphone in a microphone system. A
stereo stream has two channels (a left channel, and a right channel), a 5.1 surround sound system has 6 channels, etc. Some audio systems refer to a channel as
a complex audio stream that's mixed with other channels to produce the final mix - this is completely different to miniaudio's use of the term "channel" and
should not be confused.

3.4. Sample Rate
----------------
The sample rate in miniaudio is always expressed in Hz, such as 44100, 48000, etc. It's the number of PCM frames that are processed per second.

3.5. Formats
------------
Throughout miniaudio you will see references to different sample formats:

    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Symbol        | Description                            | Range                     |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
    | ma_format_f32 | 32-bit floating point                  | [-1, 1]                   |
    | ma_format_s16 | 16-bit signed integer                  | [-32768, 32767]           |
    | ma_format_s24 | 24-bit signed integer (tightly packed) | [-8388608, 8388607]       |
    | ma_format_s32 | 32-bit signed integer                  | [-2147483648, 2147483647] |
    | ma_format_u8  | 8-bit unsigned integer                 | [0, 255]                  |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------+

All formats are native-endian.



4. Decoding
===========
The `ma_decoder` API is used for reading audio files. The following formats are supported:

    +---------+------------------+----------+
    | Format  | Decoding Backend | Built-In |
    +---------+------------------+----------+
    | WAV     | dr_wav           | Yes      |
    | MP3     | dr_mp3           | Yes      |
    | FLAC    | dr_flac          | Yes      |
    | Vorbis  | stb_vorbis       | No       |
    +---------+------------------+----------+

Vorbis is supported via stb_vorbis which can be enabled by including the header section before the implementation of miniaudio, like the following:

    ```c
    #define STB_VORBIS_HEADER_ONLY
    #include "extras/stb_vorbis.c"    // Enables Vorbis decoding.

    #define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "miniaudio.h"

    // The stb_vorbis implementation must come after the implementation of miniaudio.
    #undef STB_VORBIS_HEADER_ONLY
    #include "extras/stb_vorbis.c"
    ```

A copy of stb_vorbis is included in the "extras" folder in the miniaudio repository (https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio).

Built-in decoders are amalgamated into the implementation section of miniaudio. You can disable the built-in decoders by specifying one or more of the
following options before the miniaudio implementation:

    ```c
    #define MA_NO_WAV
    #define MA_NO_MP3
    #define MA_NO_FLAC
    ```

Disabling built-in decoding libraries is useful if you use these libraries independantly of the `ma_decoder` API.

A decoder can be initialized from a file with `ma_decoder_init_file()`, a block of memory with `ma_decoder_init_memory()`, or from data delivered via callbacks
with `ma_decoder_init()`. Here is an example for loading a decoder from a file:

    ```c
    ma_decoder decoder;
    ma_result result = ma_decoder_init_file("MySong.mp3", NULL, &decoder);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        return false;   // An error occurred.
    }

    ...

    ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);
    ```

When initializing a decoder, you can optionally pass in a pointer to a ma_decoder_config object (the NULL argument in the example above) which allows you to
configure the output format, channel count, sample rate and channel map:

    ```c
    ma_decoder_config config = ma_decoder_config_init(ma_format_f32, 2, 48000);
    ```

When passing in NULL for decoder config in `ma_decoder_init*()`, the output format will be the same as that defined by the decoding backend.

Data is read from the decoder as PCM frames. This will return the number of PCM frames actually read. If the return value is less than the requested number of
PCM frames it means you've reached the end:

    ```c
    ma_uint64 framesRead = ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(pDecoder, pFrames, framesToRead);
    if (framesRead < framesToRead) {
        // Reached the end.
    }
    ```

You can also seek to a specific frame like so:

    ```c
    ma_result result = ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame(pDecoder, targetFrame);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        return false;   // An error occurred.
    }
    ```

If you want to loop back to the start, you can simply seek back to the first PCM frame:

    ```c
    ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame(pDecoder, 0);
    ```

When loading a decoder, miniaudio uses a trial and error technique to find the appropriate decoding backend. This can be unnecessarily inefficient if the type
is already known. In this case you can use the `_wav`, `_mp3`, etc. varients of the aforementioned initialization APIs:

    ```c
    ma_decoder_init_wav()
    ma_decoder_init_mp3()
    ma_decoder_init_memory_wav()
    ma_decoder_init_memory_mp3()
    ma_decoder_init_file_wav()
    ma_decoder_init_file_mp3()
    etc.
    ```

The `ma_decoder_init_file()` API will try using the file extension to determine which decoding backend to prefer.



5. Encoding
===========
The `ma_encoding` API is used for writing audio files. The only supported output format is WAV which is achieved via dr_wav which is amalgamated into the
implementation section of miniaudio. This can be disabled by specifying the following option before the implementation of miniaudio:

    ```c
    #define MA_NO_WAV
    ```

An encoder can be initialized to write to a file with `ma_encoder_init_file()` or from data delivered via callbacks with `ma_encoder_init()`. Below is an
example for initializing an encoder to output to a file.

    ```c
    ma_encoder_config config = ma_encoder_config_init(ma_resource_format_wav, FORMAT, CHANNELS, SAMPLE_RATE);
    ma_encoder encoder;
    ma_result result = ma_encoder_init_file("my_file.wav", &config, &encoder);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error
    }

    ...

    ma_encoder_uninit(&encoder);
    ```

When initializing an encoder you must specify a config which is initialized with `ma_encoder_config_init()`. Here you must specify the file type, the output
sample format, output channel count and output sample rate. The following file types are supported:

    +------------------------+-------------+
    | Enum                   | Description |
    +------------------------+-------------+
    | ma_resource_format_wav | WAV         |
    +------------------------+-------------+

If the format, channel count or sample rate is not supported by the output file type an error will be returned. The encoder will not perform data conversion so
you will need to convert it before outputting any audio data. To output audio data, use `ma_encoder_write_pcm_frames()`, like in the example below:

    ```c
    framesWritten = ma_encoder_write_pcm_frames(&encoder, pPCMFramesToWrite, framesToWrite);
    ```

Encoders must be uninitialized with `ma_encoder_uninit()`.


6. Data Conversion
==================
A data conversion API is included with miniaudio which supports the majority of data conversion requirements. This supports conversion between sample formats,
channel counts (with channel mapping) and sample rates.


6.1. Sample Format Conversion
-----------------------------
Conversion between sample formats is achieved with the `ma_pcm_*_to_*()`, `ma_pcm_convert()` and `ma_convert_pcm_frames_format()` APIs. Use `ma_pcm_*_to_*()`
to convert between two specific formats. Use `ma_pcm_convert()` to convert based on a `ma_format` variable. Use `ma_convert_pcm_frames_format()` to convert
PCM frames where you want to specify the frame count and channel count as a variable instead of the total sample count.


6.1.1. Dithering
----------------
Dithering can be set using the ditherMode parameter.

The different dithering modes include the following, in order of efficiency:

    +-----------+--------------------------+
    | Type      | Enum Token               |
    +-----------+--------------------------+
    | None      | ma_dither_mode_none      |
    | Rectangle | ma_dither_mode_rectangle |
    | Triangle  | ma_dither_mode_triangle  |
    +-----------+--------------------------+

Note that even if the dither mode is set to something other than `ma_dither_mode_none`, it will be ignored for conversions where dithering is not needed.
Dithering is available for the following conversions:

    ```
    s16 -> u8
    s24 -> u8
    s32 -> u8
    f32 -> u8
    s24 -> s16
    s32 -> s16
    f32 -> s16
    ```

Note that it is not an error to pass something other than ma_dither_mode_none for conversions where dither is not used. It will just be ignored.



6.2. Channel Conversion
-----------------------
Channel conversion is used for channel rearrangement and conversion from one channel count to another. The `ma_channel_converter` API is used for channel
conversion. Below is an example of initializing a simple channel converter which converts from mono to stereo.

    ```c
    ma_channel_converter_config config = ma_channel_converter_config_init(
        ma_format,                      // Sample format
        1,                              // Input channels
        NULL,                           // Input channel map
        2,                              // Output channels
        NULL,                           // Output channel map
        ma_channel_mix_mode_default);   // The mixing algorithm to use when combining channels.

    result = ma_channel_converter_init(&config, &converter);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }
    ```

To perform the conversion simply call `ma_channel_converter_process_pcm_frames()` like so:

    ```c
    ma_result result = ma_channel_converter_process_pcm_frames(&converter, pFramesOut, pFramesIn, frameCount);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }
    ```

It is up to the caller to ensure the output buffer is large enough to accomodate the new PCM frames.

Input and output PCM frames are always interleaved. Deinterleaved layouts are not supported.


6.2.1. Channel Mapping
----------------------
In addition to converting from one channel count to another, like the example above, the channel converter can also be used to rearrange channels. When
initializing the channel converter, you can optionally pass in channel maps for both the input and output frames. If the channel counts are the same, and each
channel map contains the same channel positions with the exception that they're in a different order, a simple shuffling of the channels will be performed. If,
however, there is not a 1:1 mapping of channel positions, or the channel counts differ, the input channels will be mixed based on a mixing mode which is
specified when initializing the `ma_channel_converter_config` object.

When converting from mono to multi-channel, the mono channel is simply copied to each output channel. When going the other way around, the audio of each output
channel is simply averaged and copied to the mono channel.

In more complicated cases blending is used. The `ma_channel_mix_mode_simple` mode will drop excess channels and silence extra channels. For example, converting
from 4 to 2 channels, the 3rd and 4th channels will be dropped, whereas converting from 2 to 4 channels will put silence into the 3rd and 4th channels.

The `ma_channel_mix_mode_rectangle` mode uses spacial locality based on a rectangle to compute a simple distribution between input and output. Imagine sitting
in the middle of a room, with speakers on the walls representing channel positions. The MA_CHANNEL_FRONT_LEFT position can be thought of as being in the corner
of the front and left walls.

Finally, the `ma_channel_mix_mode_custom_weights` mode can be used to use custom user-defined weights. Custom weights can be passed in as the last parameter of
`ma_channel_converter_config_init()`.

Predefined channel maps can be retrieved with `ma_get_standard_channel_map()`. This takes a `ma_standard_channel_map` enum as it's first parameter, which can
be one of the following:

    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

    +---------------+---------------------------------+



6.3. Resampling
---------------
Resampling is achieved with the `ma_resampler` object. To create a resampler object, do something like the following:

    ```c
    ma_resampler_config config = ma_resampler_config_init(
        ma_format_s16,
        channels,
        sampleRateIn,
        sampleRateOut,
        ma_resample_algorithm_linear);

    ma_resampler resampler;
    ma_result result = ma_resampler_init(&config, &resampler);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // An error occurred...
    }
    ```

Do the following to uninitialize the resampler:

    ```c
    ma_resampler_uninit(&resampler);
    ```

The following example shows how data can be processed

    ```c
    ma_uint64 frameCountIn  = 1000;
    ma_uint64 frameCountOut = 2000;
    ma_result result = ma_resampler_process_pcm_frames(&resampler, pFramesIn, &frameCountIn, pFramesOut, &frameCountOut);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // An error occurred...
    }

    // At this point, frameCountIn contains the number of input frames that were consumed and frameCountOut contains the
    // number of output frames written.
    ```

To initialize the resampler you first need to set up a config (`ma_resampler_config`) with `ma_resampler_config_init()`. You need to specify the sample format
you want to use, the number of channels, the input and output sample rate, and the algorithm.

The sample format can be either `ma_format_s16` or `ma_format_f32`. If you need a different format you will need to perform pre- and post-conversions yourself
where necessary. Note that the format is the same for both input and output. The format cannot be changed after initialization.

The resampler supports multiple channels and is always interleaved (both input and output). The channel count cannot be changed after initialization.

The sample rates can be anything other than zero, and are always specified in hertz. They should be set to something like 44100, etc. The sample rate is the
only configuration property that can be changed after initialization.

The miniaudio resampler supports multiple algorithms:

    +-----------+------------------------------+
    | Algorithm | Enum Token                   |
    +-----------+------------------------------+
    | Linear    | ma_resample_algorithm_linear |
    | Speex     | ma_resample_algorithm_speex  |
    +-----------+------------------------------+

Because Speex is not public domain it is strictly opt-in and the code is stored in separate files. if you opt-in to the Speex backend you will need to consider
it's license, the text of which can be found in it's source files in "extras/speex_resampler". Details on how to opt-in to the Speex resampler is explained in
the Speex Resampler section below.

The algorithm cannot be changed after initialization.

Processing always happens on a per PCM frame basis and always assumes interleaved input and output. De-interleaved processing is not supported. To process
frames, use `ma_resampler_process_pcm_frames()`. On input, this function takes the number of output frames you can fit in the output buffer and the number of
input frames contained in the input buffer. On output these variables contain the number of output frames that were written to the output buffer and the
number of input frames that were consumed in the process. You can pass in NULL for the input buffer in which case it will be treated as an infinitely large
buffer of zeros. The output buffer can also be NULL, in which case the processing will be treated as seek.

The sample rate can be changed dynamically on the fly. You can change this with explicit sample rates with `ma_resampler_set_rate()` and also with a decimal
ratio with `ma_resampler_set_rate_ratio()`. The ratio is in/out.

Sometimes it's useful to know exactly how many input frames will be required to output a specific number of frames. You can calculate this with
`ma_resampler_get_required_input_frame_count()`. Likewise, it's sometimes useful to know exactly how many frames would be output given a certain number of
input frames. You can do this with `ma_resampler_get_expected_output_frame_count()`.

Due to the nature of how resampling works, the resampler introduces some latency. This can be retrieved in terms of both the input rate and the output rate
with `ma_resampler_get_input_latency()` and `ma_resampler_get_output_latency()`.


6.3.1. Resampling Algorithms
----------------------------
The choice of resampling algorithm depends on your situation and requirements. The linear resampler is the most efficient and has the least amount of latency,
but at the expense of poorer quality. The Speex resampler is higher quality, but slower with more latency. It also performs several heap allocations internally
for memory management.


6.3.1.1. Linear Resampling
--------------------------
The linear resampler is the fastest, but comes at the expense of poorer quality. There is, however, some control over the quality of the linear resampler which
may make it a suitable option depending on your requirements.

The linear resampler performs low-pass filtering before or after downsampling or upsampling, depending on the sample rates you're converting between. When
decreasing the sample rate, the low-pass filter will be applied before downsampling. When increasing the rate it will be performed after upsampling. By default
a fourth order low-pass filter will be applied. This can be configured via the `lpfOrder` configuration variable. Setting this to 0 will disable filtering.

The low-pass filter has a cutoff frequency which defaults to half the sample rate of the lowest of the input and output sample rates (Nyquist Frequency). This
can be controlled with the `lpfNyquistFactor` config variable. This defaults to 1, and should be in the range of 0..1, although a value of 0 does not make
sense and should be avoided. A value of 1 will use the Nyquist Frequency as the cutoff. A value of 0.5 will use half the Nyquist Frequency as the cutoff, etc.
Values less than 1 will result in more washed out sound due to more of the higher frequencies being removed. This config variable has no impact on performance
and is a purely perceptual configuration.

The API for the linear resampler is the same as the main resampler API, only it's called `ma_linear_resampler`.


6.3.1.2. Speex Resampling
-------------------------
The Speex resampler is made up of third party code which is released under the BSD license. Because it is licensed differently to miniaudio, which is public
domain, it is strictly opt-in and all of it's code is stored in separate files. If you opt-in to the Speex resampler you must consider the license text in it's
source files. To opt-in, you must first #include the following file before the implementation of miniaudio.h:

    ```c
    #include "extras/speex_resampler/ma_speex_resampler.h"
    ```

Both the header and implementation is contained within the same file. The implementation can be included in your program like so:

    ```c
    #define MINIAUDIO_SPEEX_RESAMPLER_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "extras/speex_resampler/ma_speex_resampler.h"
    ```

Note that even if you opt-in to the Speex backend, miniaudio won't use it unless you explicitly ask for it in the respective config of the object you are
initializing. If you try to use the Speex resampler without opting in, initialization of the `ma_resampler` object will fail with `MA_NO_BACKEND`.

The only configuration option to consider with the Speex resampler is the `speex.quality` config variable. This is a value between 0 and 10, with 0 being
the fastest with the poorest quality and 10 being the slowest with the highest quality. The default value is 3.



6.4. General Data Conversion
----------------------------
The `ma_data_converter` API can be used to wrap sample format conversion, channel conversion and resampling into one operation. This is what miniaudio uses
internally to convert between the format requested when the device was initialized and the format of the backend's native device. The API for general data
conversion is very similar to the resampling API. Create a `ma_data_converter` object like this:

    ```c
    ma_data_converter_config config = ma_data_converter_config_init(
        inputFormat,
        outputFormat,
        inputChannels,
        outputChannels,
        inputSampleRate,
        outputSampleRate
    );

    ma_data_converter converter;
    ma_result result = ma_data_converter_init(&config, &converter);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // An error occurred...
    }
    ```

In the example above we use `ma_data_converter_config_init()` to initialize the config, however there's many more properties that can be configured, such as
channel maps and resampling quality. Something like the following may be more suitable depending on your requirements:

    ```c
    ma_data_converter_config config = ma_data_converter_config_init_default();
    config.formatIn = inputFormat;
    config.formatOut = outputFormat;
    config.channelsIn = inputChannels;
    config.channelsOut = outputChannels;
    config.sampleRateIn = inputSampleRate;
    config.sampleRateOut = outputSampleRate;
    ma_get_standard_channel_map(ma_standard_channel_map_flac, config.channelCountIn, config.channelMapIn);
    config.resampling.linear.lpfOrder = MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER;
    ```

Do the following to uninitialize the data converter:

    ```c
    ma_data_converter_uninit(&converter);
    ```

The following example shows how data can be processed

    ```c
    ma_uint64 frameCountIn  = 1000;
    ma_uint64 frameCountOut = 2000;
    ma_result result = ma_data_converter_process_pcm_frames(&converter, pFramesIn, &frameCountIn, pFramesOut, &frameCountOut);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // An error occurred...
    }

    // At this point, frameCountIn contains the number of input frames that were consumed and frameCountOut contains the number
    // of output frames written.
    ```

The data converter supports multiple channels and is always interleaved (both input and output). The channel count cannot be changed after initialization.

Sample rates can be anything other than zero, and are always specified in hertz. They should be set to something like 44100, etc. The sample rate is the only
configuration property that can be changed after initialization, but only if the `resampling.allowDynamicSampleRate` member of `ma_data_converter_config` is
set to MA_TRUE. To change the sample rate, use `ma_data_converter_set_rate()` or `ma_data_converter_set_rate_ratio()`. The ratio must be in/out. The resampling
algorithm cannot be changed after initialization.

Processing always happens on a per PCM frame basis and always assumes interleaved input and output. De-interleaved processing is not supported. To process
frames, use `ma_data_converter_process_pcm_frames()`. On input, this function takes the number of output frames you can fit in the output buffer and the number
of input frames contained in the input buffer. On output these variables contain the number of output frames that were written to the output buffer and the
number of input frames that were consumed in the process. You can pass in NULL for the input buffer in which case it will be treated as an infinitely large
buffer of zeros. The output buffer can also be NULL, in which case the processing will be treated as seek.

Sometimes it's useful to know exactly how many input frames will be required to output a specific number of frames. You can calculate this with
`ma_data_converter_get_required_input_frame_count()`. Likewise, it's sometimes useful to know exactly how many frames would be output given a certain number of
input frames. You can do this with `ma_data_converter_get_expected_output_frame_count()`.

Due to the nature of how resampling works, the data converter introduces some latency if resampling is required. This can be retrieved in terms of both the
input rate and the output rate with `ma_data_converter_get_input_latency()` and `ma_data_converter_get_output_latency()`.



7. Filtering
============

7.1. Biquad Filtering
---------------------
Biquad filtering is achieved with the `ma_biquad` API. Example:

    ```c
    ma_biquad_config config = ma_biquad_config_init(ma_format_f32, channels, b0, b1, b2, a0, a1, a2);
    ma_result result = ma_biquad_init(&config, &biquad);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ...

    ma_biquad_process_pcm_frames(&biquad, pFramesOut, pFramesIn, frameCount);
    ```

Biquad filtering is implemented using transposed direct form 2. The numerator coefficients are b0, b1 and b2, and the denominator coefficients are a0, a1 and
a2. The a0 coefficient is required and coefficients must not be pre-normalized.

Supported formats are `ma_format_s16` and `ma_format_f32`. If you need to use a different format you need to convert it yourself beforehand. When using
`ma_format_s16` the biquad filter will use fixed point arithmetic. When using `ma_format_f32`, floating point arithmetic will be used.

Input and output frames are always interleaved.

Filtering can be applied in-place by passing in the same pointer for both the input and output buffers, like so:

    ```c
    ma_biquad_process_pcm_frames(&biquad, pMyData, pMyData, frameCount);
    ```

If you need to change the values of the coefficients, but maintain the values in the registers you can do so with `ma_biquad_reinit()`. This is useful if you
need to change the properties of the filter while keeping the values of registers valid to avoid glitching. Do not use `ma_biquad_init()` for this as it will
do a full initialization which involves clearing the registers to 0. Note that changing the format or channel count after initialization is invalid and will
result in an error.


7.2. Low-Pass Filtering
-----------------------
Low-pass filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +---------+------------------------------------------+
    | API     | Description                              |
    +---------+------------------------------------------+
    | ma_lpf1 | First order low-pass filter              |
    | ma_lpf2 | Second order low-pass filter             |
    | ma_lpf  | High order low-pass filter (Butterworth) |
    +---------+------------------------------------------+

Low-pass filter example:

    ```c
    ma_lpf_config config = ma_lpf_config_init(ma_format_f32, channels, sampleRate, cutoffFrequency, order);
    ma_result result = ma_lpf_init(&config, &lpf);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ...

    ma_lpf_process_pcm_frames(&lpf, pFramesOut, pFramesIn, frameCount);
    ```

Supported formats are `ma_format_s16` and` ma_format_f32`. If you need to use a different format you need to convert it yourself beforehand. Input and output
frames are always interleaved.

Filtering can be applied in-place by passing in the same pointer for both the input and output buffers, like so:

    ```c
    ma_lpf_process_pcm_frames(&lpf, pMyData, pMyData, frameCount);
    ```

The maximum filter order is limited to MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER which is set to 8. If you need more, you can chain first and second order filters together.

    ```c
    for (iFilter = 0; iFilter < filterCount; iFilter += 1) {
        ma_lpf2_process_pcm_frames(&lpf2[iFilter], pMyData, pMyData, frameCount);
    }
    ```

If you need to change the configuration of the filter, but need to maintain the state of internal registers you can do so with `ma_lpf_reinit()`. This may be
useful if you need to change the sample rate and/or cutoff frequency dynamically while maintaing smooth transitions. Note that changing the format or channel
count after initialization is invalid and will result in an error.

The `ma_lpf` object supports a configurable order, but if you only need a first order filter you may want to consider using `ma_lpf1`. Likewise, if you only
need a second order filter you can use `ma_lpf2`. The advantage of this is that they're lighter weight and a bit more efficient.

If an even filter order is specified, a series of second order filters will be processed in a chain. If an odd filter order is specified, a first order filter
will be applied, followed by a series of second order filters in a chain.


7.3. High-Pass Filtering
------------------------
High-pass filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +---------+-------------------------------------------+
    | API     | Description                               |
    +---------+-------------------------------------------+
    | ma_hpf1 | First order high-pass filter              |
    | ma_hpf2 | Second order high-pass filter             |
    | ma_hpf  | High order high-pass filter (Butterworth) |
    +---------+-------------------------------------------+

High-pass filters work exactly the same as low-pass filters, only the APIs are called `ma_hpf1`, `ma_hpf2` and `ma_hpf`. See example code for low-pass filters
for example usage.


7.4. Band-Pass Filtering
------------------------
Band-pass filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +---------+-------------------------------+
    | API     | Description                   |
    +---------+-------------------------------+
    | ma_bpf2 | Second order band-pass filter |
    | ma_bpf  | High order band-pass filter   |
    +---------+-------------------------------+

Band-pass filters work exactly the same as low-pass filters, only the APIs are called `ma_bpf2` and `ma_hpf`. See example code for low-pass filters for example
usage. Note that the order for band-pass filters must be an even number which means there is no first order band-pass filter, unlike low-pass and high-pass
filters.


7.5. Notch Filtering
--------------------
Notch filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | API       | Description                              |
    +-----------+------------------------------------------+
    | ma_notch2 | Second order notching filter             |
    +-----------+------------------------------------------+


7.6. Peaking EQ Filtering
-------------------------
Peaking filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +----------+------------------------------------------+
    | API      | Description                              |
    +----------+------------------------------------------+
    | ma_peak2 | Second order peaking filter              |
    +----------+------------------------------------------+


7.7. Low Shelf Filtering
------------------------
Low shelf filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | API         | Description                              |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ma_loshelf2 | Second order low shelf filter            |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+

Where a high-pass filter is used to eliminate lower frequencies, a low shelf filter can be used to just turn them down rather than eliminate them entirely.


7.8. High Shelf Filtering
-------------------------
High shelf filtering is achieved with the following APIs:

    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | API         | Description                              |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ma_hishelf2 | Second order high shelf filter           |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+

The high shelf filter has the same API as the low shelf filter, only you would use `ma_hishelf` instead of `ma_loshelf`. Where a low shelf filter is used to
adjust the volume of low frequencies, the high shelf filter does the same thing for high frequencies.




8. Waveform and Noise Generation
================================

8.1. Waveforms
--------------
miniaudio supports generation of sine, square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms. This is achieved with the `ma_waveform` API. Example:

    ```c
    ma_waveform_config config = ma_waveform_config_init(
        FORMAT,
        CHANNELS,
        SAMPLE_RATE,
        ma_waveform_type_sine,
        amplitude,
        frequency);

    ma_waveform waveform;
    ma_result result = ma_waveform_init(&config, &waveform);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ...

    ma_waveform_read_pcm_frames(&waveform, pOutput, frameCount);
    ```

The amplitude, frequency and sample rate can be changed dynamically with `ma_waveform_set_amplitude()`, `ma_waveform_set_frequency()` and
`ma_waveform_set_sample_rate()` respectively.

You can invert the waveform by setting the amplitude to a negative value. You can use this to control whether or not a sawtooth has a positive or negative
ramp, for example.

Below are the supported waveform types:

    +---------------------------+
    | Enum Name                 |
    +---------------------------+
    | ma_waveform_type_sine     |
    | ma_waveform_type_square   |
    | ma_waveform_type_triangle |
    | ma_waveform_type_sawtooth |
    +---------------------------+



8.2. Noise
----------
miniaudio supports generation of white, pink and Brownian noise via the `ma_noise` API. Example:

    ```c
    ma_noise_config config = ma_noise_config_init(
        FORMAT,
        CHANNELS,
        ma_noise_type_white,
        SEED,
        amplitude);

    ma_noise noise;
    ma_result result = ma_noise_init(&config, &noise);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ...

    ma_noise_read_pcm_frames(&noise, pOutput, frameCount);
    ```

The noise API uses simple LCG random number generation. It supports a custom seed which is useful for things like automated testing requiring reproducibility.
Setting the seed to zero will default to MA_DEFAULT_LCG_SEED.

By default, the noise API will use different values for different channels. So, for example, the left side in a stereo stream will be different to the right
side. To instead have each channel use the same random value, set the `duplicateChannels` member of the noise config to true, like so:

    ```c
    config.duplicateChannels = MA_TRUE;
    ```

Below are the supported noise types.

    +------------------------+
    | Enum Name              |
    +------------------------+
    | ma_noise_type_white    |
    | ma_noise_type_pink     |
    | ma_noise_type_brownian |
    +------------------------+



9. Audio Buffers
================
miniaudio supports reading from a buffer of raw audio data via the `ma_audio_buffer` API. This can read from memory that's managed by the application, but
can also handle the memory management for you internally. Memory management is flexible and should support most use cases.

Audio buffers are initialised using the standard configuration system used everywhere in miniaudio:

    ```c
    ma_audio_buffer_config config = ma_audio_buffer_config_init(
        format,
        channels,
        sizeInFrames,
        pExistingData,
        &allocationCallbacks);

    ma_audio_buffer buffer;
    result = ma_audio_buffer_init(&config, &buffer);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error.
    }

    ...

    ma_audio_buffer_uninit(&buffer);
    ```

In the example above, the memory pointed to by `pExistingData` will _not_ be copied and is how an application can do self-managed memory allocation. If you
would rather make a copy of the data, use `ma_audio_buffer_init_copy()`. To uninitialize the buffer, use `ma_audio_buffer_uninit()`.

Sometimes it can be convenient to allocate the memory for the `ma_audio_buffer` structure _and_ the raw audio data in a contiguous block of memory. That is,
the raw audio data will be located immediately after the `ma_audio_buffer` structure. To do this, use `ma_audio_buffer_alloc_and_init()`:

    ```c
    ma_audio_buffer_config config = ma_audio_buffer_config_init(
        format,
        channels,
        sizeInFrames,
        pExistingData,
        &allocationCallbacks);

    ma_audio_buffer* pBuffer
    result = ma_audio_buffer_alloc_and_init(&config, &pBuffer);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error
    }

    ...
    
    ma_audio_buffer_uninit_and_free(&buffer);
    ```

If you initialize the buffer with `ma_audio_buffer_alloc_and_init()` you should uninitialize it with `ma_audio_buffer_uninit_and_free()`. In the example above,
the memory pointed to by `pExistingData` will be copied into the buffer, which is contrary to the behavior of `ma_audio_buffer_init()`.

An audio buffer has a playback cursor just like a decoder. As you read frames from the buffer, the cursor moves forward. The last parameter (`loop`) can be
used to determine if the buffer should loop. The return value is the number of frames actually read. If this is less than the number of frames requested it
means the end has been reached. This should never happen if the `loop` parameter is set to true. If you want to manually loop back to the start, you can do so
with with `ma_audio_buffer_seek_to_pcm_frame(pAudioBuffer, 0)`. Below is an example for reading data from an audio buffer.

    ```c
    ma_uint64 framesRead = ma_audio_buffer_read_pcm_frames(pAudioBuffer, pFramesOut, desiredFrameCount, isLooping);
    if (framesRead < desiredFrameCount) {
        // If not looping, this means the end has been reached. This should never happen in looping mode with valid input.
    }
    ```

Sometimes you may want to avoid the cost of data movement between the internal buffer and the output buffer. Instead you can use memory mapping to retrieve a
pointer to a segment of data:

    ```c
    void* pMappedFrames;
    ma_uint64 frameCount = frameCountToTryMapping;
    ma_result result = ma_audio_buffer_map(pAudioBuffer, &pMappedFrames, &frameCount);
    if (result == MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Map was successful. The value in frameCount will be how many frames were _actually_ mapped, which may be
        // less due to the end of the buffer being reached.
        ma_copy_pcm_frames(pFramesOut, pMappedFrames, frameCount, pAudioBuffer->format, pAudioBuffer->channels);

        // You must unmap the buffer.
        ma_audio_buffer_unmap(pAudioBuffer, frameCount);
    }
    ```

When you use memory mapping, the read cursor is increment by the frame count passed in to `ma_audio_buffer_unmap()`. If you decide not to process every frame
you can pass in a value smaller than the value returned by `ma_audio_buffer_map()`. The disadvantage to using memory mapping is that it does not handle looping
for you. You can determine if the buffer is at the end for the purpose of looping with `ma_audio_buffer_at_end()` or by inspecting the return value of
`ma_audio_buffer_unmap()` and checking if it equals `MA_AT_END`. You should not treat `MA_AT_END` as an error when returned by `ma_audio_buffer_unmap()`.



10. Ring Buffers
================
miniaudio supports lock free (single producer, single consumer) ring buffers which are exposed via the `ma_rb` and `ma_pcm_rb` APIs. The `ma_rb` API operates
on bytes, whereas the `ma_pcm_rb` operates on PCM frames. They are otherwise identical as `ma_pcm_rb` is just a wrapper around `ma_rb`.

Unlike most other APIs in miniaudio, ring buffers support both interleaved and deinterleaved streams. The caller can also allocate their own backing memory for
the ring buffer to use internally for added flexibility. Otherwise the ring buffer will manage it's internal memory for you.

The examples below use the PCM frame variant of the ring buffer since that's most likely the one you will want to use. To initialize a ring buffer, do
something like the following:

    ```c
    ma_pcm_rb rb;
    ma_result result = ma_pcm_rb_init(FORMAT, CHANNELS, BUFFER_SIZE_IN_FRAMES, NULL, NULL, &rb);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        // Error
    }
    ```

The `ma_pcm_rb_init()` function takes the sample format and channel count as parameters because it's the PCM varient of the ring buffer API. For the regular
ring buffer that operates on bytes you would call `ma_rb_init()` which leaves these out and just takes the size of the buffer in bytes instead of frames. The
fourth parameter is an optional pre-allocated buffer and the fifth parameter is a pointer to a `ma_allocation_callbacks` structure for custom memory allocation
routines. Passing in `NULL` for this results in `MA_MALLOC()` and `MA_FREE()` being used.

Use `ma_pcm_rb_init_ex()` if you need a deinterleaved buffer. The data for each sub-buffer is offset from each other based on the stride. To manage your
sub-buffers you can use `ma_pcm_rb_get_subbuffer_stride()`, `ma_pcm_rb_get_subbuffer_offset()` and `ma_pcm_rb_get_subbuffer_ptr()`.

Use 'ma_pcm_rb_acquire_read()` and `ma_pcm_rb_acquire_write()` to retrieve a pointer to a section of the ring buffer. You specify the number of frames you
need, and on output it will set to what was actually acquired. If the read or write pointer is positioned such that the number of frames requested will require
a loop, it will be clamped to the end of the buffer. Therefore, the number of frames you're given may be less than the number you requested.

After calling `ma_pcm_rb_acquire_read()` or `ma_pcm_rb_acquire_write()`, you do your work on the buffer and then "commit" it with `ma_pcm_rb_commit_read()` or
`ma_pcm_rb_commit_write()`. This is where the read/write pointers are updated. When you commit you need to pass in the buffer that was returned by the earlier
call to `ma_pcm_rb_acquire_read()` or `ma_pcm_rb_acquire_write()` and is only used for validation. The number of frames passed to `ma_pcm_rb_commit_read()` and
`ma_pcm_rb_commit_write()` is what's used to increment the pointers.

If you want to correct for drift between the write pointer and the read pointer you can use a combination of `ma_pcm_rb_pointer_distance()`,
`ma_pcm_rb_seek_read()` and `ma_pcm_rb_seek_write()`. Note that you can only move the pointers forward, and you should only move the read pointer forward via
the consumer thread, and the write pointer forward by the producer thread. If there is too much space between the pointers, move the read pointer forward. If
there is too little space between the pointers, move the write pointer forward.

You can use a ring buffer at the byte level instead of the PCM frame level by using the `ma_rb` API. This is exactly the same, only you will use the `ma_rb`
functions instead of `ma_pcm_rb` and instead of frame counts you will pass around byte counts.

The maximum size of the buffer in bytes is `0x7FFFFFFF-(MA_SIMD_ALIGNMENT-1)` due to the most significant bit being used to encode a loop flag and the internally
managed buffers always being aligned to MA_SIMD_ALIGNMENT.

Note that the ring buffer is only thread safe when used by a single consumer thread and single producer thread.

    +-------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

Some backends have some nuance details you may want to be aware of.

11.1. WASAPI
------------
- Low-latency shared mode will be disabled when using an application-defined sample rate which is different to the device's native sample rate. To work around
  this, set `wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC` to true in the device config. This is due to IAudioClient3_InitializeSharedAudioStream() failing when the
  `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_AUTOCONVERTPCM` flag is specified. Setting wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC will result in miniaudio's internal resampler being used instead
  which will in turn enable the use of low-latency shared mode.

11.2. PulseAudio
----------------
- If you experience bad glitching/noise on Arch Linux, consider this fix from the Arch wiki:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Glitches,_skips_or_crackling. Alternatively, consider using a different backend such as ALSA.

11.3. Android
-------------
- To capture audio on Android, remember to add the RECORD_AUDIO permission to your manifest: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />`
- With OpenSL|ES, only a single ma_context can be active at any given time. This is due to a limitation with OpenSL|ES.
- With AAudio, only default devices are enumerated. This is due to AAudio not having an enumeration API (devices are enumerated through Java). You can however
  perform your own device enumeration through Java and then set the ID in the ma_device_id structure (ma_device_id.aaudio) and pass it to ma_device_init().
- The backend API will perform resampling where possible. The reason for this as opposed to using miniaudio's built-in resampler is to take advantage of any
  potential device-specific optimizations the driver may implement.

11.4. UWP
---------
- UWP only supports default playback and capture devices.
- UWP requires the Microphone capability to be enabled in the application's manifest (Package.appxmanifest):

    ```
    <Package ...>
        ...
        <Capabilities>
            <DeviceCapability Name="microphone" />
        </Capabilities>
    </Package>
    ```

11.5. Web Audio / Emscripten
----------------------------
- You cannot use `-std=c*` compiler flags, nor `-ansi`. This only applies to the Emscripten build.
- The first time a context is initialized it will create a global object called "miniaudio" whose primary purpose is to act as a factory for device objects.
- Currently the Web Audio backend uses ScriptProcessorNode's, but this may need to change later as they've been deprecated.
- Google has implemented a policy in their browsers that prevent automatic media output without first receiving some kind of user input. The following web page
  has additional details: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes. Starting the device may fail if you try to start playback
  without first handling some kind of user input.



12. Miscellaneous Notes
=======================
- Automatic stream routing is enabled on a per-backend basis. Support is explicitly enabled for WASAPI and Core Audio, however other backends such as
  PulseAudio may naturally support it, though not all have been tested.
- The contents of the output buffer passed into the data callback will always be pre-initialized to zero unless the `noPreZeroedOutputBuffer` config variable
  in `ma_device_config` is set to true, in which case it'll be undefined which will require you to write something to the entire buffer.
- By default miniaudio will automatically clip samples. This only applies when the playback sample format is configured as `ma_format_f32`. If you are doing
  clipping yourself, you can disable this overhead by setting `noClip` to true in the device config.
- The sndio backend is currently only enabled on OpenBSD builds.
- The audio(4) backend is supported on OpenBSD, but you may need to disable sndiod before you can use it.
- Note that GCC and Clang requires `-msse2`, `-mavx2`, etc. for SIMD optimizations.
- When compiling with VC6 and earlier, decoding is restricted to files less than 2GB in size. This is due to 64-bit file APIs not being available.

Logging Levels
==============
A log level will automatically include the lower levels. For example, verbose logging will enable everything. The warning log level will only include warnings
and errors, but will ignore informational and verbose logging. If you only want to handle a specific log level, implement a custom log callback (see
ma_context_init() for details) and interrogate the `logLevel` parameter.

By default the log level will be set to MA_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR, but you can change this by defining MA_LOG_LEVEL before the implementation of miniaudio.

MA_LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE
    Mainly intended for debugging. This will enable all log levels and can be triggered from within the data callback so care must be taken when enabling this
    in production environments.

MA_LOG_LEVEL_INFO
    Informational logging. Useful for debugging. This will also enable warning and error logs. This will never be called from within the data callback.

MA_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING
    Warnings. You should enable this in you development builds and action them when encounted. This will also enable error logs. These logs usually indicate a
    potential problem or misconfiguration, but still allow you to keep running. This will never be called from within the data callback.

MA_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR
    Error logging. This will be fired when an operation fails and is subsequently aborted. This can be fired from within the data callback, in which case the
    device will be stopped. You should always have this log level enabled.

/*
The callback for processing audio data from the device.

The data callback is fired by miniaudio whenever the device needs to have more data delivered to a playback device, or when a capture device has some data
available. This is called as soon as the backend asks for more data which means it may be called with inconsistent frame counts. You cannot assume the
callback will be fired with a consistent frame count.


Parameters
----------
pDevice (in)
    A pointer to the relevant device.

pOutput (out)
    A pointer to the output buffer that will receive audio data that will later be played back through the speakers. This will be non-null for a playback or
    full-duplex device and null for a capture and loopback device.

pInput (in)
    A pointer to the buffer containing input data from a recording device. This will be non-null for a capture, full-duplex or loopback device and null for a
    playback device.

frameCount (in)
    The number of PCM frames to process. Note that this will not necessarily be equal to what you requested when you initialized the device. The
    `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` members of the device config are just hints, and are not necessarily exactly what you'll get. You must
    not assume this will always be the same value each time the callback is fired.


Remarks
-------
You cannot stop and start the device from inside the callback or else you'll get a deadlock. You must also not uninitialize the device from inside the
callback. The following APIs cannot be called from inside the callback:

    ma_device_init()
    ma_device_init_ex()
    ma_device_uninit()
    ma_device_start()
    ma_device_stop()

The proper way to stop the device is to call `ma_device_stop()` from a different thread, normally the main application thread.
*/
typedef void (* ma_device_callback_proc)(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount);

/*
The callback for when the device has been stopped.

This will be called when the device is stopped explicitly with `ma_device_stop()` and also called implicitly when the device is stopped through external forces
such as being unplugged or an internal error occuring.


Parameters
----------
pDevice (in)
    A pointer to the device that has just stopped.


Remarks
-------
Do not restart or uninitialize the device from the callback.
*/
typedef void (* ma_stop_proc)(ma_device* pDevice);

/*
The callback for handling log messages.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context the log message originated from.

pDevice (in)
    A pointer to the device the log message originate from, if any. This can be null, in which case the message came from the context.

logLevel (in)
    The log level. This can be one of the following:

    |----------------------|
    | Log Level            |
    |----------------------|
    | MA_LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE |
    | MA_LOG_LEVEL_INFO    |
    | MA_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING |
    | MA_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR   |
    |----------------------|

message (in)
    The log message.


Remarks
-------
Do not modify the state of the device from inside the callback.

The callback for handling device enumeration. This is fired from `ma_context_enumerated_devices()`.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context performing the enumeration.

deviceType (in)
    The type of the device being enumerated. This will always be either `ma_device_type_playback` or `ma_device_type_capture`.

pInfo (in)
    A pointer to a `ma_device_info` containing the ID and name of the enumerated device. Note that this will not include detailed information about the device,
    only basic information (ID and name). The reason for this is that it would otherwise require opening the backend device to probe for the information which
    is too inefficient.

pUserData (in)
    The user data pointer passed into `ma_context_enumerate_devices()`.

/*
Initializes a `ma_context_config` object.


Return Value
------------
A `ma_context_config` initialized to defaults.


Remarks
-------
You must always use this to initialize the default state of the `ma_context_config` object. Not using this will result in your program breaking when miniaudio
is updated and new members are added to `ma_context_config`. It also sets logical defaults.

You can override members of the returned object by changing it's members directly.

MA_API ma_context_config ma_context_config_init(void);

/*
Initializes a context.

The context is used for selecting and initializing an appropriate backend and to represent the backend at a more global level than that of an individual
device. There is one context to many devices, and a device is created from a context. A context is required to enumerate devices.


Parameters
----------
backends (in, optional)
    A list of backends to try initializing, in priority order. Can be NULL, in which case it uses default priority order.

backendCount (in, optional)
    The number of items in `backend`. Ignored if `backend` is NULL.

pConfig (in, optional)
    The context configuration.

pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context object being initialized.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Unsafe. Do not call this function across multiple threads as some backends read and write to global state.


Remarks
-------
When `backends` is NULL, the default priority order will be used. Below is a list of backends in priority order:

The context can be configured via the `pConfig` argument. The config object is initialized with `ma_context_config_init()`. Individual configuration settings
can then be set directly on the structure. Below are the members of the `ma_context_config` object.

    logCallback
        Callback for handling log messages from miniaudio. 

    threadPriority
        The desired priority to use for the audio thread. Allowable values include the following:

        |--------------------------------------|
        | Thread Priority                      |
        |--------------------------------------|
        | ma_thread_priority_idle              |
        | ma_thread_priority_lowest            |
        | ma_thread_priority_low               |
        | ma_thread_priority_normal            |

        | ma_thread_priority_highest (default) |
        | ma_thread_priority_realtime          |
        | ma_thread_priority_default           |
        |--------------------------------------|

    pUserData
        A pointer to application-defined data. This can be accessed from the context object directly such as `context.pUserData`.

    allocationCallbacks
        Structure containing custom allocation callbacks. Leaving this at defaults will cause it to use MA_MALLOC, MA_REALLOC and MA_FREE. These allocation
        callbacks will be used for anything tied to the context, including devices.

    alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration
        ALSA will typically enumerate many different devices which can be intrusive and not user-friendly. To combat this, miniaudio will enumerate only unique
        card/device pairs by default. The problem with this is that you lose a bit of flexibility and control. Setting alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration makes
        it so the ALSA backend includes all devices. Defaults to false.

    pulse.pApplicationName
        PulseAudio only. The application name to use when initializing the PulseAudio context with `pa_context_new()`.

    pulse.pServerName
        PulseAudio only. The name of the server to connect to with `pa_context_connect()`.

    pulse.tryAutoSpawn
        PulseAudio only. Whether or not to try automatically starting the PulseAudio daemon. Defaults to false. If you set this to true, keep in mind that
        miniaudio uses a trial and error method to find the most appropriate backend, and this will result in the PulseAudio daemon starting which may be
        intrusive for the end user.

    coreaudio.sessionCategory
        iOS only. The session category to use for the shared AudioSession instance. Below is a list of allowable values and their Core Audio equivalents.

        |-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

        |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

    jack.pClientName
        The name of the client to pass to `jack_client_open()`.

    jack.tryStartServer
        Whether or not to try auto-starting the JACK server. Defaults to false.


It is recommended that only a single context is active at any given time because it's a bulky data structure which performs run-time linking for the
relevant backends every time it's initialized.

The location of the context cannot change throughout it's lifetime. Consider allocating the `ma_context` object with `malloc()` if this is an issue. The
reason for this is that a pointer to the context is stored in the `ma_device` structure.


Example 1 - Default Initialization
----------------------------------
The example below shows how to initialize the context using the default configuration.

```c
ma_context context;
ma_result result = ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error.
}
```


Example 2 - Custom Configuration
--------------------------------
The example below shows how to initialize the context using custom backend priorities and a custom configuration. In this hypothetical example, the program
wants to prioritize ALSA over PulseAudio on Linux. They also want to avoid using the WinMM backend on Windows because it's latency is too high. They also
want an error to be returned if no valid backend is available which they achieve by excluding the Null backend.

For the configuration, the program wants to capture any log messages so they can, for example, route it to a log file and user interface.

```c
ma_backend backends[] = {
    ma_backend_alsa,
    ma_backend_pulseaudio,
    ma_backend_wasapi,
    ma_backend_dsound
};

ma_context_config config = ma_context_config_init();
config.logCallback = my_log_callback;
config.pUserData   = pMyUserData;

ma_context context;
ma_result result = ma_context_init(backends, sizeof(backends)/sizeof(backends[0]), &config, &context);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error.
    if (result == MA_NO_BACKEND) {
        // Couldn't find an appropriate backend.
    }
}
```

MA_API ma_result ma_context_init(const ma_backend backends[], ma_uint32 backendCount, const ma_context_config* pConfig, ma_context* pContext);

/*
Uninitializes a context.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Unsafe. Do not call this function across multiple threads as some backends read and write to global state.


Remarks
-------
Results are undefined if you call this while any device created by this context is still active.


See Also
--------
ma_context_init()
*/
MA_API ma_result ma_context_uninit(ma_context* pContext);

/*
Retrieves the size of the ma_context object.

This is mainly for the purpose of bindings to know how much memory to allocate.
*/
MA_API size_t ma_context_sizeof(void);

/*
Enumerates over every device (both playback and capture).

This is a lower-level enumeration function to the easier to use `ma_context_get_devices()`. Use `ma_context_enumerate_devices()` if you would rather not incur
an internal heap allocation, or it simply suits your code better.

Note that this only retrieves the ID and name/description of the device. The reason for only retrieving basic information is that it would otherwise require
opening the backend device in order to probe it for more detailed information which can be inefficient. Consider using `ma_context_get_device_info()` for this,
but don't call it from within the enumeration callback.

Returning false from the callback will stop enumeration. Returning true will continue enumeration.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context performing the enumeration.

callback (in)
    The callback to fire for each enumerated device.

pUserData (in)
    A pointer to application-defined data passed to the callback.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Safe. This is guarded using a simple mutex lock.


Remarks
-------
Do _not_ assume the first enumerated device of a given type is the default device.

Some backends and platforms may only support default playback and capture devices.

In general, you should not do anything complicated from within the callback. In particular, do not try initializing a device from within the callback. Also,
do not try to call `ma_context_get_device_info()` from within the callback.

Consider using `ma_context_get_devices()` for a simpler and safer API, albeit at the expense of an internal heap allocation.


Example 1 - Simple Enumeration
------------------------------
ma_bool32 ma_device_enum_callback(ma_context* pContext, ma_device_type deviceType, const ma_device_info* pInfo, void* pUserData)
{
    printf("Device Name: %s\n", pInfo->name);
    return MA_TRUE;
}

ma_result result = ma_context_enumerate_devices(&context, my_device_enum_callback, pMyUserData);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error.
}


See Also
--------
ma_context_get_devices()
*/
MA_API ma_result ma_context_enumerate_devices(ma_context* pContext, ma_enum_devices_callback_proc callback, void* pUserData);

/*
Retrieves basic information about every active playback and/or capture device.

This function will allocate memory internally for the device lists and return a pointer to them through the `ppPlaybackDeviceInfos` and `ppCaptureDeviceInfos`
parameters. If you do not want to incur the overhead of these allocations consider using `ma_context_enumerate_devices()` which will instead use a callback.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context performing the enumeration.

ppPlaybackDeviceInfos (out)
    A pointer to a pointer that will receive the address of a buffer containing the list of `ma_device_info` structures for playback devices.

pPlaybackDeviceCount (out)
    A pointer to an unsigned integer that will receive the number of playback devices.

ppCaptureDeviceInfos (out)
    A pointer to a pointer that will receive the address of a buffer containing the list of `ma_device_info` structures for capture devices.

pCaptureDeviceCount (out)
    A pointer to an unsigned integer that will receive the number of capture devices.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Unsafe. Since each call to this function invalidates the pointers from the previous call, you should not be calling this simultaneously across multiple
threads. Instead, you need to make a copy of the returned data with your own higher level synchronization.


Remarks
-------
It is _not_ safe to assume the first device in the list is the default device.

You can pass in NULL for the playback or capture lists in which case they'll be ignored.

The returned pointers will become invalid upon the next call this this function, or when the context is uninitialized. Do not free the returned pointers.

/*
Retrieves information about a device of the given type, with the specified ID and share mode.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in)
    A pointer to the context performing the query.

deviceType (in)
    The type of the device being queried. Must be either `ma_device_type_playback` or `ma_device_type_capture`.

pDeviceID (in)
    The ID of the device being queried.

shareMode (in)
    The share mode to query for device capabilities. This should be set to whatever you're intending on using when initializing the device. If you're unsure,
    set this to `ma_share_mode_shared`.

pDeviceInfo (out)
    A pointer to the `ma_device_info` structure that will receive the device information.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Safe. This is guarded using a simple mutex lock.


Remarks
-------
Do _not_ call this from within the `ma_context_enumerate_devices()` callback.

It's possible for a device to have different information and capabilities depending on whether or not it's opened in shared or exclusive mode. For example, in
shared mode, WASAPI always uses floating point samples for mixing, but in exclusive mode it can be anything. Therefore, this function allows you to specify
which share mode you want information for. Note that not all backends and devices support shared or exclusive mode, in which case this function will fail if
the requested share mode is unsupported.

This leaves pDeviceInfo unmodified in the result of an error.

/*
Initializes a device config with default settings.


Parameters
----------
deviceType (in)
    The type of the device this config is being initialized for. This must set to one of the following:

    |-------------------------|
    | Device Type             |
    |-------------------------|
    | ma_device_type_playback |
    | ma_device_type_capture  |
    | ma_device_type_duplex   |
    | ma_device_type_loopback |
    |-------------------------|


Return Value
------------
A new device config object with default settings. You will typically want to adjust the config after this function returns. See remarks.


Thread Safety
-------------
Safe.


Callback Safety
---------------
Safe, but don't try initializing a device in a callback.


Remarks
-------
The returned config will be initialized to defaults. You will normally want to customize a few variables before initializing the device. See Example 1 for a
typical configuration which sets the sample format, channel count, sample rate, data callback and user data. These are usually things you will want to change
before initializing the device.

See `ma_device_init()` for details on specific configuration options.


Example 1 - Simple Configuration
--------------------------------
The example below is what a program will typically want to configure for each device at a minimum. Notice how `ma_device_config_init()` is called first, and
then the returned object is modified directly. This is important because it ensures that your program continues to work as new configuration options are added
to the `ma_device_config` structure.

```c
ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
config.playback.format   = ma_format_f32;
config.playback.channels = 2;
config.sampleRate        = 48000;
config.dataCallback      = ma_data_callback;
config.pUserData         = pMyUserData;
```

ma_device_init()
ma_device_init_ex()
*/
MA_API ma_device_config ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type deviceType);


/*
Initializes a device.

A device represents a physical audio device. The idea is you send or receive audio data from the device to either play it back through a speaker, or capture it
from a microphone. Whether or not you should send or receive data from the device (or both) depends on the type of device you are initializing which can be
playback, capture, full-duplex or loopback. (Note that loopback mode is only supported on select backends.) Sending and receiving audio data to and from the
device is done via a callback which is fired by miniaudio at periodic time intervals.

The frequency at which data is delivered to and from a device depends on the size of it's period. The size of the period can be defined in terms of PCM frames
or milliseconds, whichever is more convenient. Generally speaking, the smaller the period, the lower the latency at the expense of higher CPU usage and
increased risk of glitching due to the more frequent and granular data deliver intervals. The size of a period will depend on your requirements, but
miniaudio's defaults should work fine for most scenarios. If you're building a game you should leave this fairly small, whereas if you're building a simple
media player you can make it larger. Note that the period size you request is actually just a hint - miniaudio will tell the backend what you want, but the
backend is ultimately responsible for what it gives you. You cannot assume you will get exactly what you ask for.

When delivering data to and from a device you need to make sure it's in the correct format which you can set through the device configuration. You just set the
format that you want to use and miniaudio will perform all of the necessary conversion for you internally. When delivering data to and from the callback you
can assume the format is the same as what you requested when you initialized the device. See Remarks for more details on miniaudio's data conversion pipeline.


Parameters
----------
pContext (in, optional)
    A pointer to the context that owns the device. This can be null, in which case it creates a default context internally.

pConfig (in)
    A pointer to the device configuration. Cannot be null. See remarks for details.

pDevice (out)
    A pointer to the device object being initialized.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this function simultaneously for different devices because some backends depend on and mutate global state. The same applies to
calling this at the same time as `ma_device_uninit()`.


Callback Safety
---------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this inside any callback.


Remarks
-------
Setting `pContext` to NULL will result in miniaudio creating a default context internally and is equivalent to passing in a context initialized like so:

    ```c
    ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
    ```

Do not set `pContext` to NULL if you are needing to open multiple devices. You can, however, use NULL when initializing the first device, and then use
device.pContext for the initialization of other devices.

The device can be configured via the `pConfig` argument. The config object is initialized with `ma_device_config_init()`. Individual configuration settings can
then be set directly on the structure. Below are the members of the `ma_device_config` object.

    deviceType
        Must be `ma_device_type_playback`, `ma_device_type_capture`, `ma_device_type_duplex` of `ma_device_type_loopback`.

    sampleRate
        The sample rate, in hertz. The most common sample rates are 48000 and 44100. Setting this to 0 will use the device's native sample rate.

    periodSizeInFrames
        The desired size of a period in PCM frames. If this is 0, `periodSizeInMilliseconds` will be used instead. If both are 0 the default buffer size will
        be used depending on the selected performance profile. This value affects latency. See below for details.

    periodSizeInMilliseconds
        The desired size of a period in milliseconds. If this is 0, `periodSizeInFrames` will be used instead. If both are 0 the default buffer size will be
        used depending on the selected performance profile. The value affects latency. See below for details.

    periods
        The number of periods making up the device's entire buffer. The total buffer size is `periodSizeInFrames` or `periodSizeInMilliseconds` multiplied by
        this value. This is just a hint as backends will be the ones who ultimately decide how your periods will be configured.

    performanceProfile
        A hint to miniaudio as to the performance requirements of your program. Can be either `ma_performance_profile_low_latency` (default) or
        `ma_performance_profile_conservative`. This mainly affects the size of default buffers and can usually be left at it's default value.

    noPreZeroedOutputBuffer
        When set to true, the contents of the output buffer passed into the data callback will be left undefined. When set to false (default), the contents of
        the output buffer will be cleared the zero. You can use this to avoid the overhead of zeroing out the buffer if you can guarantee that your data
        callback will write to every sample in the output buffer, or if you are doing your own clearing.

    noClip
        When set to true, the contents of the output buffer passed into the data callback will be clipped after returning. When set to false (default), the
        contents of the output buffer are left alone after returning and it will be left up to the backend itself to decide whether or not the clip. This only
        applies when the playback sample format is f32.

    dataCallback
        The callback to fire whenever data is ready to be delivered to or from the device.

    stopCallback
        The callback to fire whenever the device has stopped, either explicitly via `ma_device_stop()`, or implicitly due to things like the device being
        disconnected.

    pUserData
        The user data pointer to use with the device. You can access this directly from the device object like `device.pUserData`.

    resampling.algorithm
        The resampling algorithm to use when miniaudio needs to perform resampling between the rate specified by `sampleRate` and the device's native rate. The
        default value is `ma_resample_algorithm_linear`, and the quality can be configured with `resampling.linear.lpfOrder`.

    resampling.linear.lpfOrder
        The linear resampler applies a low-pass filter as part of it's procesing for anti-aliasing. This setting controls the order of the filter. The higher
        the value, the better the quality, in general. Setting this to 0 will disable low-pass filtering altogether. The maximum value is
        `MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER`. The default value is `min(4, MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER)`.

    playback.pDeviceID
        A pointer to a `ma_device_id` structure containing the ID of the playback device to initialize. Setting this NULL (default) will use the system's
        default playback device. Retrieve the device ID from the `ma_device_info` structure, which can be retrieved using device enumeration.

    playback.format
        The sample format to use for playback. When set to `ma_format_unknown` the device's native format will be used. This can be retrieved after
        initialization from the device object directly with `device.playback.format`.

    playback.channels
        The number of channels to use for playback. When set to 0 the device's native channel count will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization
        from the device object directly with `device.playback.channels`.

    playback.channelMap
        The channel map to use for playback. When left empty, the device's native channel map will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization from the
        device object direct with `device.playback.channelMap`.

    playback.shareMode
        The preferred share mode to use for playback. Can be either `ma_share_mode_shared` (default) or `ma_share_mode_exclusive`. Note that if you specify
        exclusive mode, but it's not supported by the backend, initialization will fail. You can then fall back to shared mode if desired by changing this to
        ma_share_mode_shared and reinitializing.

    capture.pDeviceID
        A pointer to a `ma_device_id` structure containing the ID of the capture device to initialize. Setting this NULL (default) will use the system's
        default capture device. Retrieve the device ID from the `ma_device_info` structure, which can be retrieved using device enumeration.

    capture.format
        The sample format to use for capture. When set to `ma_format_unknown` the device's native format will be used. This can be retrieved after
        initialization from the device object directly with `device.capture.format`.

    capture.channels
        The number of channels to use for capture. When set to 0 the device's native channel count will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization
        from the device object directly with `device.capture.channels`.

    capture.channelMap
        The channel map to use for capture. When left empty, the device's native channel map will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization from the
        device object direct with `device.capture.channelMap`.

    capture.shareMode
        The preferred share mode to use for capture. Can be either `ma_share_mode_shared` (default) or `ma_share_mode_exclusive`. Note that if you specify
        exclusive mode, but it's not supported by the backend, initialization will fail. You can then fall back to shared mode if desired by changing this to
        ma_share_mode_shared and reinitializing.

    wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC
        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables WASAPI's automatic resampling and forces the use of miniaudio's resampler. Defaults to false. 

    wasapi.noDefaultQualitySRC
        WASAPI only. Only used when `wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC` is set to false. When set to true, disables the use of `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_SRC_DEFAULT_QUALITY`.
        You should usually leave this set to false, which is the default.

    wasapi.noAutoStreamRouting
        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables automatic stream routing on the WASAPI backend. Defaults to false.

    wasapi.noHardwareOffloading
        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables the use of WASAPI's hardware offloading feature. Defaults to false.

    alsa.noMMap
        ALSA only. When set to true, disables MMap mode. Defaults to false.

    alsa.noAutoFormat
        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic format conversion by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_FORMAT flag. Defaults to false.

    alsa.noAutoChannels
        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic channel conversion by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_CHANNELS flag. Defaults to false.

    alsa.noAutoResample
        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic resampling by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_RESAMPLE flag. Defaults to false.

    pulse.pStreamNamePlayback
        PulseAudio only. Sets the stream name for playback.

    pulse.pStreamNameCapture
        PulseAudio only. Sets the stream name for capture.


Once initialized, the device's config is immutable. If you need to change the config you will need to initialize a new device.

After initializing the device it will be in a stopped state. To start it, use `ma_device_start()`.

If both `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` are set to zero, it will default to `MA_DEFAULT_PERIOD_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_LOW_LATENCY` or
`MA_DEFAULT_PERIOD_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_CONSERVATIVE`, depending on whether or not `performanceProfile` is set to `ma_performance_profile_low_latency` or
`ma_performance_profile_conservative`.

If you request exclusive mode and the backend does not support it an error will be returned. For robustness, you may want to first try initializing the device
in exclusive mode, and then fall back to shared mode if required. Alternatively you can just request shared mode (the default if you leave it unset in the
config) which is the most reliable option. Some backends do not have a practical way of choosing whether or not the device should be exclusive or not (ALSA,
for example) in which case it just acts as a hint. Unless you have special requirements you should try avoiding exclusive mode as it's intrusive to the user.
Starting with Windows 10, miniaudio will use low-latency shared mode where possible which may make exclusive mode unnecessary.

When sending or receiving data to/from a device, miniaudio will internally perform a format conversion to convert between the format specified by the config
and the format used internally by the backend. If you pass in 0 for the sample format, channel count, sample rate _and_ channel map, data transmission will run
on an optimized pass-through fast path. You can retrieve the format, channel count and sample rate by inspecting the `playback/capture.format`,
`playback/capture.channels` and `sampleRate` members of the device object.

When compiling for UWP you must ensure you call this function on the main UI thread because the operating system may need to present the user with a message
asking for permissions. Please refer to the official documentation for ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync() for more information.

ALSA Specific: When initializing the default device, requesting shared mode will try using the "dmix" device for playback and the "dsnoop" device for capture.
If these fail it will try falling back to the "hw" device.


Example 1 - Simple Initialization
---------------------------------
This example shows how to initialize a simple playback device using a standard configuration. If you are just needing to do simple playback from the default
playback device this is usually all you need.

```c
ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
config.playback.format   = ma_format_f32;
config.playback.channels = 2;
config.sampleRate        = 48000;
config.dataCallback      = ma_data_callback;
config.pMyUserData       = pMyUserData;

ma_device device;
ma_result result = ma_device_init(NULL, &config, &device);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error
}
```


Example 2 - Advanced Initialization
-----------------------------------
This example shows how you might do some more advanced initialization. In this hypothetical example we want to control the latency by setting the buffer size
and period count. We also want to allow the user to be able to choose which device to output from which means we need a context so we can perform device
enumeration.

```c
ma_context context;
ma_result result = ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error
}

ma_device_info* pPlaybackDeviceInfos;
ma_uint32 playbackDeviceCount;
result = ma_context_get_devices(&context, &pPlaybackDeviceInfos, &playbackDeviceCount, NULL, NULL);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error
}

// ... choose a device from pPlaybackDeviceInfos ...

ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
config.playback.pDeviceID       = pMyChosenDeviceID;    // <-- Get this from the `id` member of one of the `ma_device_info` objects returned by ma_context_get_devices().
config.playback.format          = ma_format_f32;
config.playback.channels        = 2;
config.sampleRate               = 48000;
config.dataCallback             = ma_data_callback;
config.pUserData                = pMyUserData;
config.periodSizeInMilliseconds = 10;
config.periods                  = 3;

ma_device device;
result = ma_device_init(&context, &config, &device);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    // Error
}
```

MA_API ma_result ma_device_init(ma_context* pContext, const ma_device_config* pConfig, ma_device* pDevice);

/*
Initializes a device without a context, with extra parameters for controlling the configuration of the internal self-managed context.

This is the same as `ma_device_init()`, only instead of a context being passed in, the parameters from `ma_context_init()` are passed in instead. This function
allows you to configure the internally created context.


Parameters
----------
backends (in, optional)
    A list of backends to try initializing, in priority order. Can be NULL, in which case it uses default priority order.

backendCount (in, optional)
    The number of items in `backend`. Ignored if `backend` is NULL.

pContextConfig (in, optional)
    The context configuration.

pConfig (in)
    A pointer to the device configuration. Cannot be null. See remarks for details.

pDevice (out)
    A pointer to the device object being initialized.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this function simultaneously for different devices because some backends depend on and mutate global state. The same applies to
calling this at the same time as `ma_device_uninit()`.


Callback Safety
---------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this inside any callback.


Remarks
-------
You only need to use this function if you want to configure the context differently to it's defaults. You should never use this function if you want to manage
your own context.

See the documentation for `ma_context_init()` for information on the different context configuration options.

----------
pDevice (in)

---------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this inside any callback.


Remarks
-------
For a playback device, this will retrieve an initial chunk of audio data from the client before returning. The reason for this is to ensure there is valid
audio data in the buffer, which needs to be done before the device begins playback.

Do not call this in any callback.

*/
MA_API ma_result ma_device_start(ma_device* pDevice);

/*
Stops the device. For playback devices this stops playback. For capture devices it stops recording.

Use `ma_device_start()` to start the device again.


Parameters
----------
pDevice (in)
    A pointer to the device to stop.


Return Value
------------
MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Safe. It's safe to call this from any thread with the exception of the callback thread.


Callback Safety
---------------
Unsafe. It is not safe to call this inside any callback. Doing this will result in a deadlock.


Remarks
-------
This API needs to wait on the worker thread to stop the backend device properly before returning. It also waits on a mutex for thread-safety. In addition, some
backends need to wait for the device to finish playback/recording of the current fragment which can take some time (usually proportionate to the buffer size
that was specified at initialization time).

Backends are required to either pause the stream in-place or drain the buffer if pausing is not possible. The reason for this is that stopping the device and
the resuming it with ma_device_start() (which you might do when your program loses focus) may result in a situation where those samples are never output to the
speakers or received from the microphone which can in turn result in de-syncs.

Do not call this in any callback.

This will be called implicitly by `ma_device_uninit()`.

Parameters
----------
pDevice (in)

Return Value
------------
True if the device is started, false otherwise.


Thread Safety
-------------
Safe. If another thread calls `ma_device_start()` or `ma_device_stop()` at this same time as this function is called, there's a very small chance the return

Safe. This is implemented as a simple accessor.

Parameters
----------

/*
_wfopen() isn't always available in all compilation environments.

    * MinGW-64 (both 32- and 64-bit) seems to support it.
    * MinGW wraps it in !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__).

This can be reviewed as compatibility issues arise. The preference is to use _wfopen_s() and _wfopen() as opposed to the wcsrtombs()
fallback, so if you notice your compiler not detecting this properly I'm happy to look at adding support.

Unfortunately using runtime linking for pthreads causes problems. This has occurred for me when testing on FreeBSD. When
using runtime linking, deadlocks can occur (for me it happens when loading data from fread()). It turns out that doing
compile-time linking fixes this. I'm not sure why this happens, but the safest way I can think of to fix this is to simply
disable runtime linking by default. To enable runtime linking, #define this before the implementation of this file. I am
not officially supporting this, but I'm leaving it here in case it's useful for somebody, somewhere.

        any of these flags will result in HRESULT code 0x88890021. The other problem is that calling IAudioClient3_GetSharedModeEnginePeriod() with a sample rate different to
        that returned by IAudioClient_GetMixFormat() also results in an error. I'm therefore disabling low-latency shared mode with AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_AUTOCONVERTPCM.

COM objects. The way these work is that you have a vtable (a list of function pointers, kind of
like how C++ works internally), and then you have a structure with a single member, which is a
pointer to the vtable. The vtable is where the methods of the object are defined. Methods need
to be in a specific order, and parent classes need to have their methods declared first.

        It appears there's either a bug in ALSA, a bug in some drivers, or I'm doing something silly; but having resampling enabled causes
        problems with some device configurations when used in conjunction with MMAP access mode. To fix this problem we need to disable
        resampling.
        
        To reproduce this problem, open the "plug:dmix" device, and set the sample rate to 44100. Internally, it looks like dmix uses a
        sample rate of 48000. The hardware parameters will get set correctly with no errors, but it looks like the 44100 -> 48000 resampling
        doesn't work properly - but only with MMAP access mode. You will notice skipping/crackling in the audio, and it'll run at a slightly
        faster rate.
        
        miniaudio has built-in support for sample rate conversion (albeit low quality at the moment), so disabling resampling should be fine
        for us. The only problem is that it won't be taking advantage of any kind of hardware-accelerated resampling and it won't be very
        good quality until I get a chance to improve the quality of miniaudio's software sample rate conversion.
        
        I don't currently know if the dmix plugin is the only one with this error. Indeed, this is the only one I've been able to reproduce
        this error with. In the future, we may want to restrict the disabling of resampling to only known bad plugins.

Core Audio

So far, Core Audio has been the worst backend to work with due to being both unintuitive and having almost no documentation
apart from comments in the headers (which admittedly are quite good). For my own purposes, and for anybody out there whose
needing to figure out how this darn thing works, I'm going to outline a few things here.

Since miniaudio is a fairly low-level API, one of the things it needs is control over specific devices, and it needs to be
able to identify whether or not it can be used as playback and/or capture. The AudioObject API is the only one I've seen
that supports this level of detail. There was some public domain sample code I stumbled across that used the AudioComponent
and AudioUnit APIs, but I couldn't see anything that gave low-level control over device selection and capabilities (the
distinction between playback and capture in particular). Therefore, miniaudio is using the AudioObject API.

Most (all?) functions in the AudioObject API take a AudioObjectID as it's input. This is the device identifier. When
retrieving global information, such as the device list, you use kAudioObjectSystemObject. When retrieving device-specific
data, you pass in the ID for that device. In order to retrieve device-specific IDs you need to enumerate over each of the
devices. This is done using the AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() and AudioObjectGetPropertyData() APIs which seem to be
the central APIs for retrieving information about the system and specific devices.

To use the AudioObjectGetPropertyData() API you need to use the notion of a property address. A property address is a
structure with three variables and is used to identify which property you are getting or setting. The first is the "selector"
which is basically the specific property that you're wanting to retrieve or set. The second is the "scope", which is
typically set to kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal, kAudioObjectPropertyScopeInput for input-specific properties and
kAudioObjectPropertyScopeOutput for output-specific properties. The last is the "element" which is always set to
kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster in miniaudio's case. I don't know of any cases where this would be set to anything different.

Back to the earlier issue of device retrieval, you first use the AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() API to retrieve the size
of the raw data which is just a list of AudioDeviceID's. You use the kAudioObjectSystemObject AudioObjectID, and a property
address with the kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices selector and the kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal scope. Once you have the
size, allocate a block of memory of that size and then call AudioObjectGetPropertyData(). The data is just a list of
AudioDeviceID's so just do "dataSize/sizeof(AudioDeviceID)" to know the device count.

        ScriptProcessorNode is actually deprecated so this is likely to be temporary. The way this works for playback is very simple. You just set a callback
        that's periodically fired, just like a normal audio callback function. But apparently this design is "flawed" and is now deprecated in favour of
        something called AudioWorklets which _forces_ you to load a _separate_ .js file at run time... nice... Hopefully ScriptProcessorNode will continue to
        work for years to come, but this may need to change to use AudioSourceBufferNode instead, which I think is what Emscripten uses for it's built-in SDL
        implementation. I'll be avoiding that insane AudioWorklet API like the plague...

        For capture it is a bit unintuitive. We use the ScriptProccessorNode _only_ to get the raw PCM data. It is connected to an AudioContext just like the
        playback case, however we just output silence to the AudioContext instead of passing any real data. It would make more sense to me to use the
        MediaRecorder API, but unfortunately you need to specify a MIME time (Opus, Vorbis, etc.) for the binary blob that's returned to the client, but I've
        been unable to figure out how to get this as raw PCM. The closest I can think is to use the MIME type for WAV files and just parse it, but I don't know
        how well this would work. Although ScriptProccessorNode is deprecated, in practice it seems to have pretty good browser support so I'm leaving it like
        this for now. If anyone knows how I could get raw PCM data using the MediaRecorder API please let me know!

    Imagine the following simplified example: You have a single input speaker which is the front/left speaker which you want to convert to
    the following output configuration:
    
     - front/left
     - side/left
     - back/left
    
    The front/left output is easy - it the same speaker position so it receives the full contribution of the front/left input. The amount
    of contribution to apply to the side/left and back/left speakers, however, is a bit more complicated.
    
    Imagine the front/left speaker as emitting audio from two planes - the front plane and the left plane. You can think of the front/left
    speaker emitting half of it's total volume from the front, and the other half from the left. Since part of it's volume is being emitted
    from the left side, and the side/left and back/left channels also emit audio from the left plane, one would expect that they would
    receive some amount of contribution from front/left speaker. The amount of contribution depends on how many planes are shared between
    the two speakers. Note that in the examples below I've added a top/front/left speaker as an example just to show how the math works
    across 3 spatial dimensions.
    
    The first thing to do is figure out how each speaker's volume is spread over each of plane:
     - front/left:     2 planes (front and left)      = 1/2 = half it's total volume on each plane
     - side/left:      1 plane (left only)            = 1/1 = entire volume from left plane
     - back/left:      2 planes (back and left)       = 1/2 = half it's total volume on each plane
     - top/front/left: 3 planes (top, front and left) = 1/3 = one third it's total volume on each plane
    
    The amount of volume each channel contributes to each of it's planes is what controls how much it is willing to given and take to other
    channels on the same plane. The volume that is willing to the given by one channel is multiplied by the volume that is willing to be

RELEASE NOTES - VERSION 0.10.x
==============================
Version 0.10 includes major API changes and refactoring, mostly concerned with the data conversion system. Data conversion is performed internally to convert
audio data between the format requested when initializing the `ma_device` object and the format of the internal device used by the backend. The same applies
to the `ma_decoder` object. The previous design has several design flaws and missing features which necessitated a complete redesign.


Changes to Data Conversion
--------------------------
The previous data conversion system used callbacks to deliver input data for conversion. This design works well in some specific situations, but in other
situations it has some major readability and maintenance issues. The decision was made to replace this with a more iterative approach where you just pass in a
pointer to the input data directly rather than dealing with a callback.

The following are the data conversion APIs that have been removed and their replacements:

  - ma_format_converter -> ma_convert_pcm_frames_format()
  - ma_channel_router   -> ma_channel_converter
  - ma_src              -> ma_resampler
  - ma_pcm_converter    -> ma_data_converter

The previous conversion APIs accepted a callback in their configs. There are no longer any callbacks to deal with. Instead you just pass the data into the
`*_process_pcm_frames()` function as a pointer to a buffer.

The simplest aspect of data conversion is sample format conversion. To convert between two formats, just call `ma_convert_pcm_frames_format()`. Channel
conversion is also simple which you can do with `ma_channel_converter` via `ma_channel_converter_process_pcm_frames()`.

Resampling is more complicated because the number of output frames that are processed is different to the number of input frames that are consumed. When you
call `ma_resampler_process_pcm_frames()` you need to pass in the number of input frames available for processing and the number of output frames you want to
output. Upon returning they will receive the number of input frames that were consumed and the number of output frames that were generated.

The `ma_data_converter` API is a wrapper around format, channel and sample rate conversion and handles all of the data conversion you'll need which probably
makes it the best option if you need to do data conversion.

In addition to changes to the API design, a few other changes have been made to the data conversion pipeline:

  - The sinc resampler has been removed. This was completely broken and never actually worked properly.
  - The linear resampler now uses low-pass filtering to remove aliasing. The quality of the low-pass filter can be controlled via the resampler config with the
    `lpfOrder` option, which has a maximum value of MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER.
  - Data conversion now supports s16 natively which runs through a fixed point pipeline. Previously everything needed to be converted to floating point before
    processing, whereas now both s16 and f32 are natively supported. Other formats still require conversion to either s16 or f32 prior to processing, however
    `ma_data_converter` will handle this for you.


Custom Memory Allocators
------------------------
miniaudio has always supported macro level customization for memory allocation via MA_MALLOC, MA_REALLOC and MA_FREE, however some scenarios require more
flexibility by allowing a user data pointer to be passed to the custom allocation routines. Support for this has been added to version 0.10 via the
`ma_allocation_callbacks` structure. Anything making use of heap allocations has been updated to accept this new structure.

The `ma_context_config` structure has been updated with a new member called `allocationCallbacks`. Leaving this set to it's defaults returned by
`ma_context_config_init()` will cause it to use MA_MALLOC, MA_REALLOC and MA_FREE. Likewise, The `ma_decoder_config` structure has been updated in the same
way, and leaving everything as-is after `ma_decoder_config_init()` will cause it to use the same defaults.

The following APIs have been updated to take a pointer to a `ma_allocation_callbacks` object. Setting this parameter to NULL will cause it to use defaults.
Otherwise they will use the relevant callback in the structure.

  - ma_malloc()
  - ma_realloc()
  - ma_free()
  - ma_aligned_malloc()
  - ma_aligned_free()
  - ma_rb_init() / ma_rb_init_ex()
  - ma_pcm_rb_init() / ma_pcm_rb_init_ex()

Note that you can continue to use MA_MALLOC, MA_REALLOC and MA_FREE as per normal. These will continue to be used by default if you do not specify custom
allocation callbacks.


Buffer and Period Configuration Changes
---------------------------------------
The way in which the size of the internal buffer and periods are specified in the device configuration have changed. In previous versions, the config variables
`bufferSizeInFrames` and `bufferSizeInMilliseconds` defined the size of the entire buffer, with the size of a period being the size of this variable divided by
the period count. This became confusing because people would expect the value of `bufferSizeInFrames` or `bufferSizeInMilliseconds` to independantly determine
latency, when in fact it was that value divided by the period count that determined it. These variables have been removed and replaced with new ones called
`periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds`.

These new configuration variables work in the same way as their predecessors in that if one is set to 0, the other will be used, but the main difference is
that you now set these to you desired latency rather than the size of the entire buffer. The benefit of this is that it's much easier and less confusing to
configure latency.

The following unused APIs have been removed:

    ma_get_default_buffer_size_in_milliseconds()
    ma_get_default_buffer_size_in_frames()

The following macros have been removed:

    MA_BASE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_LOW_LATENCY
    MA_BASE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_CONSERVATIVE


Other API Changes
-----------------
Other less major API changes have also been made in version 0.10.

`ma_device_set_stop_callback()` has been removed. If you require a stop callback, you must now set it via the device config just like the data callback.

The `ma_sine_wave` API has been replaced with a more general API called `ma_waveform`. This supports generation of different types of waveforms, including
sine, square, triangle and sawtooth. Use `ma_waveform_init()` in place of `ma_sine_wave_init()` to initialize the waveform object. This takes a configuration
object called `ma_waveform_config` which defines the properties of the waveform. Use `ma_waveform_config_init()` to initialize a `ma_waveform_config` object.
Use `ma_waveform_read_pcm_frames()` in place of `ma_sine_wave_read_f32()` and `ma_sine_wave_read_f32_ex()`.

`ma_convert_frames()` and `ma_convert_frames_ex()` have been changed. Both of these functions now take a new parameter called `frameCountOut` which specifies
the size of the output buffer in PCM frames. This has been added for safety. In addition to this, the parameters for `ma_convert_frames_ex()` have changed to
take a pointer to a `ma_data_converter_config` object to specify the input and output formats to convert between. This was done to make it more flexible, to
prevent the parameter list getting too long, and to prevent API breakage whenever a new conversion property is added.

`ma_calculate_frame_count_after_src()` has been renamed to `ma_calculate_frame_count_after_resampling()` for consistency with the new `ma_resampler` API.

    |-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

These filters all support 32-bit floating point and 16-bit signed integer formats natively. Other formats need to be converted beforehand.


Sine, Square, Triangle and Sawtooth Waveforms
---------------------------------------------
Previously miniaudio supported only sine wave generation. This has now been generalized to support sine, square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms. The old
`ma_sine_wave` API has been removed and replaced with the `ma_waveform` API. Use `ma_waveform_config_init()` to initialize a config object, and then pass it
into `ma_waveform_init()`. Then use `ma_waveform_read_pcm_frames()` to read PCM data.


Noise Generation
----------------
A noise generation API has been added. This is used via the `ma_noise` API. Currently white, pink and Brownian noise is supported. The `ma_noise` API is
similar to the waveform API. Use `ma_noise_config_init()` to initialize a config object, and then pass it into `ma_noise_init()` to initialize a `ma_noise`
object. Then use `ma_noise_read_pcm_frames()` to read PCM data.


Miscellaneous Changes
---------------------
The MA_NO_STDIO option has been removed. This would disable file I/O APIs, however this has proven to be too hard to maintain for it's perceived value and was
therefore removed.

Internal functions have all been made static where possible. If you get warnings about unused functions, please submit a bug report.

The `ma_device` structure is no longer defined as being aligned to MA_SIMD_ALIGNMENT. This resulted in a possible crash when allocating a `ma_device` object on
the heap, but not aligning it to MA_SIMD_ALIGNMENT. This crash would happen due to the compiler seeing the alignment specified on the structure and assuming it
was always aligned as such and thinking it was safe to emit alignment-dependant SIMD instructions. Since miniaudio's philosophy is for things to just work,
this has been removed from all structures.

Results codes have been overhauled. Unnecessary result codes have been removed, and some have been renumbered for organisation purposes. If you are are binding
maintainer you will need to update your result codes. Support has also been added for retrieving a human readable description of a given result code via the
`ma_result_description()` API.

ALSA: The automatic format conversion, channel conversion and resampling performed by ALSA is now disabled by default as they were causing some compatibility
issues with certain devices and configurations. These can be individually enabled via the device config:

    ```c
    deviceConfig.alsa.noAutoFormat   = MA_TRUE;
    deviceConfig.alsa.noAutoChannels = MA_TRUE;
    deviceConfig.alsa.noAutoResample = MA_TRUE;
    ```

RELEASE NOTES - VERSION 0.9.x
=============================
Version 0.9 includes major API changes, centered mostly around full-duplex and the rebrand to "miniaudio". Before I go into detail about the major changes I
would like to apologize. I know it's annoying dealing with breaking API changes, but I think it's best to get these changes out of the way now while the
library is still relatively young and unknown.

There's been a lot of refactoring with this release so there's a good chance a few bugs have been introduced. I apologize in advance for this. You may want to
hold off on upgrading for the short term if you're worried. If mini_al v0.8.14 works for you, and you don't need full-duplex support, you can avoid upgrading
(though you won't be getting future bug fixes).


Rebranding to "miniaudio"
-------------------------
The decision was made to rename mini_al to miniaudio. Don't worry, it's the same project. The reason for this is simple:

1) Having the word "audio" in the title makes it immediately clear that the library is related to audio; and
2) I don't like the look of the underscore.

This rebrand has necessitated a change in namespace from "mal" to "ma". I know this is annoying, and I apologize, but it's better to get this out of the road
now rather than later. Also, since there are necessary API changes for full-duplex support I think it's better to just get the namespace change over and done
with at the same time as the full-duplex changes. I'm hoping this will be the last of the major API changes. Fingers crossed!

The implementation define is now "#define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION". You can also use "#define MA_IMPLEMENTATION" if that's your preference.


Full-Duplex Support
-------------------
The major feature added to version 0.9 is full-duplex. This has necessitated a few API changes.

1) The data callback has now changed. Previously there was one type of callback for playback and another for capture. I wanted to avoid a third callback just
   for full-duplex so the decision was made to break this API and unify the callbacks. Now, there is just one callback which is the same for all three modes
   (playback, capture, duplex). The new callback looks like the following:

       void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount);

   This callback allows you to move data straight out of the input buffer and into the output buffer in full-duplex mode. In playback-only mode, pInput will be
   null. Likewise, pOutput will be null in capture-only mode. The sample count is no longer returned from the callback since it's not necessary for miniaudio
   anymore.

2) The device config needed to change in order to support full-duplex. Full-duplex requires the ability to allow the client to choose a different PCM format
   for the playback and capture sides. The old ma_device_config object simply did not allow this and needed to change. With these changes you now specify the
   device ID, format, channels, channel map and share mode on a per-playback and per-capture basis (see example below). The sample rate must be the same for
   playback and capture.

   Since the device config API has changed I have also decided to take the opportunity to simplify device initialization. Now, the device ID, device type and
   callback user data are set in the config. ma_device_init() is now simplified down to taking just the context, device config and a pointer to the device
   object being initialized. The rationale for this change is that it just makes more sense to me that these are set as part of the config like everything
   else.

   Example device initialization:

       ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_duplex);   // Or ma_device_type_playback or ma_device_type_capture.
       config.playback.pDeviceID = &myPlaybackDeviceID; // Or NULL for the default playback device.
       config.playback.format    = ma_format_f32;
       config.playback.channels  = 2;
       config.capture.pDeviceID  = &myCaptureDeviceID;  // Or NULL for the default capture device.
       config.capture.format     = ma_format_s16;
       config.capture.channels   = 1;
       config.sampleRate         = 44100;
       config.dataCallback       = data_callback;
       config.pUserData          = &myUserData;

       result = ma_device_init(&myContext, &config, &device);
       if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
           ... handle error ...
       }

   Note that the "onDataCallback" member of ma_device_config has been renamed to "dataCallback". Also, "onStopCallback" has been renamed to "stopCallback".

This is the first pass for full-duplex and there is a known bug. You will hear crackling on the following backends when sample rate conversion is required for
the playback device:
  - Core Audio
  - JACK
  - AAudio
  - OpenSL
  - WebAudio

In addition to the above, not all platforms have been absolutely thoroughly tested simply because I lack the hardware for such thorough testing. If you
experience a bug, an issue report on GitHub or an email would be greatly appreciated (and a sample program that reproduces the issue if possible).


Other API Changes
-----------------
In addition to the above, the following API changes have been made:

- The log callback is no longer passed to ma_context_config_init(). Instead you need to set it manually after initialization.
- The onLogCallback member of ma_context_config has been renamed to "logCallback".
- The log callback now takes a logLevel parameter. The new callback looks like: void log_callback(ma_context* pContext, ma_device* pDevice, ma_uint32 logLevel, const char* message)
  - You can use ma_log_level_to_string() to convert the logLevel to human readable text if you want to log it.
- Some APIs have been renamed:
  - mal_decoder_read()          -> ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames()
  - mal_decoder_seek_to_frame() -> ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame()
  - mal_sine_wave_read()        -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32()
  - mal_sine_wave_read_ex()     -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32_ex()
- Some APIs have been removed:
  - mal_device_get_buffer_size_in_bytes()
  - mal_device_set_recv_callback()
  - mal_device_set_send_callback()
  - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate()
  - mal_src_set_output_sample_rate()
- Error codes have been rearranged. If you're a binding maintainer you will need to update.
- The ma_backend enums have been rearranged to priority order. The rationale for this is to simplify automatic backend selection and to make it easier to see
  the priority. If you're a binding maintainer you will need to update.
- ma_dsp has been renamed to ma_pcm_converter. The rationale for this change is that I'm expecting "ma_dsp" to conflict with some future planned high-level
  APIs.
- For functions that take a pointer/count combo, such as ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(), the parameter order has changed so that the pointer comes before the
  count. The rationale for this is to keep it consistent with things like memcpy().


Miscellaneous Changes
---------------------
The following miscellaneous changes have also been made.

- The AAudio backend has been added for Android 8 and above. This is Android's new "High-Performance Audio" API. (For the record, this is one of the nicest
  audio APIs out there, just behind the BSD audio APIs).
- The WebAudio backend has been added. This is based on ScriptProcessorNode. This removes the need for SDL.
- The SDL and OpenAL backends have been removed. These were originally implemented to add support for platforms for which miniaudio was not explicitly
  supported. These are no longer needed and have therefore been removed.
- Device initialization now fails if the requested share mode is not supported. If you ask for exclusive mode, you either get an exclusive mode device, or an
  error. The rationale for this change is to give the client more control over how to handle cases when the desired shared mode is unavailable.
- A lock-free ring buffer API has been added. There are two varients of this. "ma_rb" operates on bytes, whereas "ma_pcm_rb" operates on PCM frames.
- The library is now licensed as a choice of Public Domain (Unlicense) _or_ MIT-0 (No Attribution) which is the same as MIT, but removes the attribution
  requirement. The rationale for this is to support countries that don't recognize public domain.

    longer required. Decoding of WAV, FLAC and MP3 should be supported seamlessly without any additional libraries. Decoders can be excluded from the build
    with the following options:
    - MA_NO_WAV
    - MA_NO_FLAC
    - MA_NO_MP3
    If you get errors about multiple definitions you need to either enable the options above, move the implementation of dr_wav, dr_flac and/or dr_mp3 to before

  - Change ma_data_source_seek_pcm_frames() to return a result code and output the frames seeked as an output parameter.
  - Change ma_audio_buffer_unmap() to return MA_AT_END when the end has been reached. This should be considered successful.
  - Change playback.pDeviceID and capture.pDeviceID to constant pointers in ma_device_config.
  - Add support for initializing decoders from a virtual file system object. This is achieved via the ma_vfs API and allows the application to customize file
    IO for the loading and reading of raw audio data. Passing in NULL for the VFS will use defaults. New APIs:
    - ma_decoder_init_vfs()
    - ma_decoder_init_vfs_wav()

  - Fix some warnings with GCC and -std=c89.
  - Fix some formatting warnings with GCC and -Wall and -Wpedantic.
  - Fix some warnings with VC6.
  - Minor optimization to ma_copy_pcm_frames(). This is now a no-op when the input and output buffers are the same.

v0.10.7 - 2020-05-25
  - Fix a compilation error in the C++ build.
  - Silence a warning.

v0.10.6 - 2020-05-24

    callbacks:
    - ma_malloc()
    - ma_realloc()
    - ma_free()
    - ma_aligned_malloc()
    - ma_aligned_free()
    - ma_rb_init() / ma_rb_init_ex()
    - ma_pcm_rb_init() / ma_pcm_rb_init_ex()
  - API CHANGE: Simplify latency specification in device configurations. The bufferSizeInFrames and bufferSizeInMilliseconds parameters have been replaced with
    periodSizeInFrames and periodSizeInMilliseconds respectively. The previous variables defined the size of the entire buffer, whereas the new ones define the
    size of a period. The following APIs have been removed since they are no longer relevant:
    - ma_get_default_buffer_size_in_milliseconds()
    - ma_get_default_buffer_size_in_frames()
  - API CHANGE: ma_device_set_stop_callback() has been removed. If you require a stop callback, you must now set it via the device config just like the data
    callback.

  - API CHANGE: ma_convert_frames() has been updated to take an extra parameter which is the size of the output buffer in PCM frames. Parameters have also been
    reordered.
  - API CHANGE: ma_convert_frames_ex() has been changed to take a pointer to a ma_data_converter_config object to specify the input and output formats to
    convert between.
  - API CHANGE: ma_calculate_frame_count_after_src() has been renamed to ma_calculate_frame_count_after_resampling().
  - Add support for the following filters:
    - Biquad (ma_biquad)
    - First order low-pass (ma_lpf1)
    - Second order low-pass (ma_lpf2)
    - Low-pass with configurable order (ma_lpf)

    - Sine
    - Square
    - Triangle
    - Sawtooth
  - Add noise generation API (ma_noise) with support for the following:
    - White

  - iOS: Fix a crash on device uninitialization.

v0.9.9 - 2020-01-09
  - Fix compilation errors with MinGW.
  - Fix compilation errors when compiling on Apple platforms.
  - WASAPI: Add support for disabling hardware offloading.
  - WASAPI: Add support for disabling automatic stream routing.
  - Core Audio: Fix bugs in the case where the internal device uses deinterleaved buffers.
  - Core Audio: Add support for controlling the session category (AVAudioSessionCategory) and options (AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions).
  - JACK: Fix bug where incorrect ports are connected.

v0.9.8 - 2019-10-07
  - WASAPI: Fix a potential deadlock when starting a full-duplex device.
  - WASAPI: Enable automatic resampling by default. Disable with config.wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC.
  - Core Audio: Fix bugs with automatic stream routing.
  - Add support for controlling whether or not the content of the output buffer passed in to the data callback is pre-initialized
    to zero. By default it will be initialized to zero, but this can be changed by setting noPreZeroedOutputBuffer in the device
    config. Setting noPreZeroedOutputBuffer to true will leave the contents undefined.
  - Add support for clipping samples after the data callback has returned. This only applies when the playback sample format is
    configured as ma_format_f32. If you are doing clipping yourself, you can disable this overhead by setting noClip to true in
    the device config.
  - Add support for master volume control for devices.
    - Use ma_device_set_master_volume() to set the volume to a factor between 0 and 1, where 0 is silence and 1 is full volume.
    - Use ma_device_set_master_gain_db() to set the volume in decibels where 0 is full volume and < 0 reduces the volume.
  - Fix warnings emitted by GCC when `__inline__` is undefined or defined as nothing.

v0.9.7 - 2019-08-28
  - Add support for loopback mode (WASAPI only).
    - To use this, set the device type to ma_device_type_loopback, and then fill out the capture section of the device config.
    - If you need to capture from a specific output device, set the capture device ID to that of a playback device.
  - Fix a crash when an error is posted in ma_device_init().
  - Fix a compilation error when compiling for ARM architectures.
  - Fix a bug with the audio(4) backend where the device is incorrectly being opened in non-blocking mode.

  - Minor refactoring to the WinMM, ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS, audio(4), sndio and null backends.

v0.9.6 - 2019-08-04
  - Add support for loading decoders using a wchar_t string for file paths.
  - Don't trigger an assert when ma_device_start() is called on a device that is already started. This will now log a warning
    and return MA_INVALID_OPERATION. The same applies for ma_device_stop().
  - Try fixing an issue with PulseAudio taking a long time to start playback.
  - Fix a bug in ma_convert_frames() and ma_convert_frames_ex().
  - Fix memory leaks in the WASAPI backend.
  - Fix a compilation error with Visual Studio 2010.

v0.9.5 - 2019-05-21
  - Add logging to ma_dlopen() and ma_dlsym().
  - Add ma_decoder_get_length_in_pcm_frames().
  - Fix a bug with capture on the OpenSL|ES backend.
  - Fix a bug with the ALSA backend where a device would not restart after being stopped.

v0.9.4 - 2019-05-06
  - Add support for C89. With this change, miniaudio should compile clean with GCC/Clang with "-std=c89 -ansi -pedantic" and
    Microsoft compilers back to VC6. Other compilers should also work, but have not been tested.

v0.9.3 - 2019-04-19
  - Fix compiler errors on GCC when compiling with -std=c99.

v0.9.2 - 2019-04-08
  - Add support for per-context user data.
  - Fix a potential bug with context configs.
  - Fix some bugs with PulseAudio.

v0.9.1 - 2019-03-17
  - Fix a bug where the output buffer is not getting zeroed out before calling the data callback. This happens when
    the device is running in passthrough mode (not doing any data conversion).
  - Fix an issue where the data callback is getting called too frequently on the WASAPI and DirectSound backends.
  - Fix error on the UWP build.
  - Fix a build error on Apple platforms.

v0.9 - 2019-03-06
  - Rebranded to "miniaudio". All namespaces have been renamed from "mal" to "ma".
  - API CHANGE: ma_device_init() and ma_device_config_init() have changed significantly:
    - The device type, device ID and user data pointer have moved from ma_device_init() to the config.
    - All variations of ma_device_config_init_*() have been removed in favor of just ma_device_config_init().
    - ma_device_config_init() now takes only one parameter which is the device type. All other properties need
      to be set on the returned object directly.
    - The onDataCallback and onStopCallback members of ma_device_config have been renamed to "dataCallback"
      and "stopCallback".
    - The ID of the physical device is now split into two: one for the playback device and the other for the
      capture device. This is required for full-duplex. These are named "pPlaybackDeviceID" and "pCaptureDeviceID".
  - API CHANGE: The data callback has changed. It now uses a unified callback for all device types rather than
    being separate for each. It now takes two pointers - one containing input data and the other output data. This
    design in required for full-duplex. The return value is now void instead of the number of frames written. The
    new callback looks like the following:
        void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount);
  - API CHANGE: Remove the log callback parameter from ma_context_config_init(). With this change,
    ma_context_config_init() now takes no parameters and the log callback is set via the structure directly. The
    new policy for config initialization is that only mandatory settings are passed in to *_config_init(). The
    "onLog" member of ma_context_config has been renamed to "logCallback".
  - API CHANGE: Remove ma_device_get_buffer_size_in_bytes().
  - API CHANGE: Rename decoding APIs to "pcm_frames" convention.
    - mal_decoder_read()          -> ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames()
    - mal_decoder_seek_to_frame() -> ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame()
  - API CHANGE: Rename sine wave reading APIs to f32 convention.
    - mal_sine_wave_read()    -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32()
    - mal_sine_wave_read_ex() -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32_ex()
  - API CHANGE: Remove some deprecated APIs
    - mal_device_set_recv_callback()
    - mal_device_set_send_callback()
    - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate()
    - mal_src_set_output_sample_rate()
  - API CHANGE: Add log level to the log callback. New signature:
    - void on_log(ma_context* pContext, ma_device* pDevice, ma_uint32 logLevel, const char* message)
  - API CHANGE: Changes to result codes. Constants have changed and unused codes have been removed. If you're
    a binding mainainer you will need to update your result code constants.
  - API CHANGE: Change the order of the ma_backend enums to priority order. If you are a binding maintainer, you
    will need to update.
  - API CHANGE: Rename mal_dsp to ma_pcm_converter. All functions have been renamed from mal_dsp_*() to
    ma_pcm_converter_*(). All structures have been renamed from mal_dsp* to ma_pcm_converter*.
  - API CHANGE: Reorder parameters of ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames() to be consistent with the new parameter order scheme.
  - The resampling algorithm has been changed from sinc to linear. The rationale for this is that the sinc implementation
    is too inefficient right now. This will hopefully be improved at a later date.
  - Device initialization will no longer fall back to shared mode if exclusive mode is requested but is unusable.
    With this change, if you request an device in exclusive mode, but exclusive mode is not supported, it will not
    automatically fall back to shared mode. The client will need to reinitialize the device in shared mode if that's
    what they want.
  - Add ring buffer API. This is ma_rb and ma_pcm_rb, the difference being that ma_rb operates on bytes and
    ma_pcm_rb operates on PCM frames.
  - Add Web Audio backend. This is used when compiling with Emscripten. The SDL backend, which was previously
    used for web support, will be removed in a future version.
  - Add AAudio backend (Android Audio). This is the new priority backend for Android. Support for AAudio starts
    with Android 8. OpenSL|ES is used as a fallback for older versions of Android.
  - Remove OpenAL and SDL backends.
  - Fix a possible deadlock when rapidly stopping the device after it has started.
  - Update documentation.
  - Change licensing to a choice of public domain _or_ MIT-0 (No Attribution).

v0.8.14 - 2018-12-16
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug where the device state is not set correctly after stopping.
  - Add support for custom weights to the channel router.
  - Update decoders to use updated APIs in dr_flac, dr_mp3 and dr_wav.

v0.8.13 - 2018-12-04
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug with channel mapping.
  - Fix a bug with channel routing where the back/left and back/right channels have the wrong weight.

v0.8.12 - 2018-11-27
  - Drop support for SDL 1.2. The Emscripten build now requires "-s USE_SDL=2".
  - Fix a linking error with ALSA.
  - Fix a bug on iOS where the device name is not set correctly.

v0.8.11 - 2018-11-21
  - iOS bug fixes.
  - Minor tweaks to PulseAudio.

v0.8.10 - 2018-10-21
  - Core Audio: Fix a hang when uninitializing a device.
  - Fix a bug where an incorrect value is returned from mal_device_stop().

v0.8.9 - 2018-09-28
  - Fix a bug with the SDL backend where device initialization fails.

v0.8.8 - 2018-09-14
  - Fix Linux build with the ALSA backend.
  - Minor documentation fix.

v0.8.7 - 2018-09-12
  - Fix a bug with UWP detection.

v0.8.6 - 2018-08-26
  - Automatically switch the internal device when the default device is unplugged. Note that this is still in the
    early stages and not all backends handle this the same way. As of this version, this will not detect a default
    device switch when changed from the operating system's audio preferences (unless the backend itself handles
    this automatically). This is not supported in exclusive mode.
  - WASAPI and Core Audio: Add support for stream routing. When the application is using a default device and the
    user switches the default device via the operating system's audio preferences, miniaudio will automatically switch
    the internal device to the new default. This is not supported in exclusive mode.
  - WASAPI: Add support for hardware offloading via IAudioClient2. Only supported on Windows 8 and newer.
  - WASAPI: Add support for low-latency shared mode via IAudioClient3. Only supported on Windows 10 and newer.
  - Add support for compiling the UWP build as C.
  - mal_device_set_recv_callback() and mal_device_set_send_callback() have been deprecated. You must now set this
    when the device is initialized with mal_device_init*(). These will be removed in version 0.9.0.

v0.8.5 - 2018-08-12
  - Add support for specifying the size of a device's buffer in milliseconds. You can still set the buffer size in
    frames if that suits you. When bufferSizeInFrames is 0, bufferSizeInMilliseconds will be used. If both are non-0
    then bufferSizeInFrames will take priority. If both are set to 0 the default buffer size is used.
  - Add support for the audio(4) backend to OpenBSD.
  - Fix a bug with the ALSA backend that was causing problems on Raspberry Pi. This significantly improves the
    Raspberry Pi experience.
  - Fix a bug where an incorrect number of samples is returned from sinc resampling.
  - Add support for setting the value to be passed to internal calls to CoInitializeEx().
  - WASAPI and WinMM: Stop the device when it is unplugged.

v0.8.4 - 2018-08-06
  - Add sndio backend for OpenBSD.
  - Add audio(4) backend for NetBSD.
  - Drop support for the OSS backend on everything except FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD.
  - Formats are now native-endian (were previously little-endian).
  - Mark some APIs as deprecated:
    - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate() and mal_src_set_output_sample_rate() are replaced with mal_src_set_sample_rate().
    - mal_dsp_set_input_sample_rate() and mal_dsp_set_output_sample_rate() are replaced with mal_dsp_set_sample_rate().
  - Fix a bug when capturing using the WASAPI backend.
  - Fix some aliasing issues with resampling, specifically when increasing the sample rate.
  - Fix warnings.

v0.8.3 - 2018-07-15
  - Fix a crackling bug when resampling in capture mode.
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug where capture does not work.
  - ALSA: Fix a bug where the worker thread can get stuck in an infinite loop.
  - PulseAudio: Fix a bug where mal_context_init() succeeds when PulseAudio is unusable.
  - JACK: Fix a bug where mal_context_init() succeeds when JACK is unusable.

v0.8.2 - 2018-07-07
  - Fix a bug on macOS with Core Audio where the internal callback is not called.

v0.8.1 - 2018-07-06
  - Fix compilation errors and warnings.

v0.8 - 2018-07-05
  - Changed MAL_IMPLEMENTATION to MINI_AL_IMPLEMENTATION for consistency with other libraries. The old
    way is still supported for now, but you should update as it may be removed in the future.
  - API CHANGE: Replace device enumeration APIs. mal_enumerate_devices() has been replaced with
    mal_context_get_devices(). An additional low-level device enumration API has been introduced called
    mal_context_enumerate_devices() which uses a callback to report devices.
  - API CHANGE: Rename mal_get_sample_size_in_bytes() to mal_get_bytes_per_sample() and add
    mal_get_bytes_per_frame().
  - API CHANGE: Replace mal_device_config.preferExclusiveMode with mal_device_config.shareMode.
    - This new config can be set to mal_share_mode_shared (default) or mal_share_mode_exclusive.
  - API CHANGE: Remove excludeNullDevice from mal_context_config.alsa.
  - API CHANGE: Rename MAL_MAX_SAMPLE_SIZE_IN_BYTES to MAL_MAX_PCM_SAMPLE_SIZE_IN_BYTES.
  - API CHANGE: Change the default channel mapping to the standard Microsoft mapping.
  - API CHANGE: Remove backend-specific result codes.
  - API CHANGE: Changes to the format conversion APIs (mal_pcm_f32_to_s16(), etc.)
  - Add support for Core Audio (Apple).
  - Add support for PulseAudio.
    - This is the highest priority backend on Linux (higher priority than ALSA) since it is commonly
      installed by default on many of the popular distros and offer's more seamless integration on
      platforms where PulseAudio is used. In addition, if PulseAudio is installed and running (which
      is extremely common), it's better to just use PulseAudio directly rather than going through the
      "pulse" ALSA plugin (which is what the "default" ALSA device is likely set to).
  - Add support for JACK.
  - Remove dependency on asound.h for the ALSA backend. This means the ALSA development packages are no
    longer required to build miniaudio.
  - Remove dependency on dsound.h for the DirectSound backend. This fixes build issues with some
    distributions of MinGW.
  - Remove dependency on audioclient.h for the WASAPI backend. This fixes build issues with some
    distributions of MinGW.
  - Add support for dithering to format conversion.
  - Add support for configuring the priority of the worker thread.
  - Add a sine wave generator.
  - Improve efficiency of sample rate conversion.
  - Introduce the notion of standard channel maps. Use mal_get_standard_channel_map().
  - Introduce the notion of default device configurations. A default config uses the same configuration
    as the backend's internal device, and as such results in a pass-through data transmission pipeline.
  - Add support for passing in NULL for the device config in mal_device_init(), which uses a default
    config. This requires manually calling mal_device_set_send/recv_callback().
  - Add support for decoding from raw PCM data (mal_decoder_init_raw(), etc.)
  - Make mal_device_init_ex() more robust.
  - Make some APIs more const-correct.
  - Fix errors with SDL detection on Apple platforms.
  - Fix errors with OpenAL detection.
  - Fix some memory leaks.
  - Fix a bug with opening decoders from memory.
  - Early work on SSE2, AVX2 and NEON optimizations.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.
  - Documentation updates.

v0.7 - 2018-02-25
  - API CHANGE: Change mal_src_read_frames() and mal_dsp_read_frames() to use 64-bit sample counts.
  - Add decoder APIs for loading WAV, FLAC, Vorbis and MP3 files.
  - Allow opening of devices without a context.
    - In this case the context is created and managed internally by the device.
  - Change the default channel mapping to the same as that used by FLAC.
  - Fix build errors with macOS.

v0.6c - 2018-02-12
  - Fix build errors with BSD/OSS.

v0.6b - 2018-02-03
  - Fix some warnings when compiling with Visual C++.

v0.6a - 2018-01-26
  - Fix errors with channel mixing when increasing the channel count.
  - Improvements to the build system for the OpenAL backend.
  - Documentation fixes.

v0.6 - 2017-12-08
  - API CHANGE: Expose and improve mutex APIs. If you were using the mutex APIs before this version you'll
    need to update.
  - API CHANGE: SRC and DSP callbacks now take a pointer to a mal_src and mal_dsp object respectively.
  - API CHANGE: Improvements to event and thread APIs. These changes make these APIs more consistent.
  - Add support for SDL and Emscripten.
  - Simplify the build system further for when development packages for various backends are not installed.
    With this change, when the compiler supports __has_include, backends without the relevant development
    packages installed will be ignored. This fixes the build for old versions of MinGW.
  - Fixes to the Android build.
  - Add mal_convert_frames(). This is a high-level helper API for performing a one-time, bulk conversion of
    audio data to a different format.
  - Improvements to f32 -> u8/s16/s24/s32 conversion routines.
  - Fix a bug where the wrong value is returned from mal_device_start() for the OpenSL backend.
  - Fixes and improvements for Raspberry Pi.
  - Warning fixes.

v0.5 - 2017-11-11
  - API CHANGE: The mal_context_init() function now takes a pointer to a mal_context_config object for
    configuring the context. The works in the same kind of way as the device config. The rationale for this
    change is to give applications better control over context-level properties, add support for backend-
    specific configurations, and support extensibility without breaking the API.
  - API CHANGE: The alsa.preferPlugHW device config variable has been removed since it's not really useful for
    anything anymore.
  - ALSA: By default, device enumeration will now only enumerate over unique card/device pairs. Applications
    can enable verbose device enumeration by setting the alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration context config
    variable.
  - ALSA: When opening a device in shared mode (the default), the dmix/dsnoop plugin will be prioritized. If
    this fails it will fall back to the hw plugin. With this change the preferExclusiveMode config is now
    honored. Note that this does not happen when alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration is set to true (see above)
    which is by design.
  - ALSA: Add support for excluding the "null" device using the alsa.excludeNullDevice context config variable.
  - ALSA: Fix a bug with channel mapping which causes an assertion to fail.
  - Fix errors with enumeration when pInfo is set to NULL.
  - OSS: Fix a bug when starting a device when the client sends 0 samples for the initial buffer fill.

v0.4 - 2017-11-05
  - API CHANGE: The log callback is now per-context rather than per-device and as is thus now passed to
    mal_context_init(). The rationale for this change is that it allows applications to capture diagnostic
    messages at the context level. Previously this was only available at the device level.
  - API CHANGE: The device config passed to mal_device_init() is now const.
  - Added support for OSS which enables support on BSD platforms.
  - Added support for WinMM (waveOut/waveIn).
  - Added support for UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications. Currently C++ only.
  - Added support for exclusive mode for selected backends. Currently supported on WASAPI.
  - POSIX builds no longer require explicit linking to libpthread (-lpthread).
  - ALSA: Explicit linking to libasound (-lasound) is no longer required.
  - ALSA: Latency improvements.
  - ALSA: Use MMAP mode where available. This can be disabled with the alsa.noMMap config.
  - ALSA: Use "hw" devices instead of "plughw" devices by default. This can be disabled with the
    alsa.preferPlugHW config.
  - WASAPI is now the highest priority backend on Windows platforms.
  - Fixed an error with sample rate conversion which was causing crackling when capturing.
  - Improved error handling.
  - Improved compiler support.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

v0.3 - 2017-06-19
  - API CHANGE: Introduced the notion of a context. The context is the highest level object and is required for
    enumerating and creating devices. Now, applications must first create a context, and then use that to
    enumerate and create devices. The reason for this change is to ensure device enumeration and creation is
    tied to the same backend. In addition, some backends are better suited to this design.
  - API CHANGE: Removed the rewinding APIs because they're too inconsistent across the different backends, hard
    to test and maintain, and just generally unreliable.
  - Added helper APIs for initializing mal_device_config objects.
  - Null Backend: Fixed a crash when recording.
  - Fixed build for UWP.
  - Added support for f32 formats to the OpenSL|ES backend.
  - Added initial implementation of the WASAPI backend.
  - Added initial implementation of the OpenAL backend.
  - Added support for low quality linear sample rate conversion.
  - Added early support for basic channel mapping.

v0.2 - 2016-10-28
  - API CHANGE: Add user data pointer as the last parameter to mal_device_init(). The rationale for this
    change is to ensure the logging callback has access to the user data during initialization.
  - API CHANGE: Have device configuration properties be passed to mal_device_init() via a structure. Rationale:
    1) The number of parameters is just getting too much.
    2) It makes it a bit easier to add new configuration properties in the future. In particular, there's a
       chance there will be support added for backend-specific properties.
  - Dropped support for f64, A-law and Mu-law formats since they just aren't common enough to justify the
    added maintenance cost.
  - DirectSound: Increased the default buffer size for capture devices.
  - Added initial implementation of the OpenSL|ES backend.

v0.1 - 2016-10-21
  - Initial versioned release.
