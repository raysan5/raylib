MAJOR CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9
============================
Version 0.9 includes major API changes, centered mostly around full-duplex and the rebrand to "miniaudio". Before I go into
detail about the major changes I would like to apologize. I know it's annoying dealing with breaking API changes, but I think
it's best to get these changes out of the way now while the library is still relatively young and unknown.

There's been a lot of refactoring with this release so there's a good chance a few bugs have been introduced. I apologize in
advance for this. You may want to hold off on upgrading for the short term if you're worried. If mini_al v0.8.14 works for
you, and you don't need full-duplex support, you can avoid upgrading (though you won't be getting future bug fixes).


Rebranding to "miniaudio"
-------------------------
The decision was made to rename mini_al to miniaudio. Don't worry, it's the same project. The reason for this is simple:

1) Having the word "audio" in the title makes it immediately clear that the library is related to audio; and
2) I don't like the look of the underscore.

This rebrand has necessitated a change in namespace from "mal" to "ma". I know this is annoying, and I apologize, but it's
better to get this out of the road now rather than later. Also, since there are necessary API changes for full-duplex support
I think it's better to just get the namespace change over and done with at the same time as the full-duplex changes. I'm hoping
this will be the last of the major API changes. Fingers crossed!

The implementation define is now "#define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION". You can also use "#define MA_IMPLEMENTATION" if that's
your preference.


Full-Duplex Support
-------------------
The major feature added to version 0.9 is full-duplex. This has necessitated a few API changes.

1) The data callback has now changed. Previously there was one type of callback for playback and another for capture. I wanted
   to avoid a third callback just for full-duplex so the decision was made to break this API and unify the callbacks. Now,
   there is just one callback which is the same for all three modes (playback, capture, duplex). The new callback looks like
   the following:

       void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount);

   This callback allows you to move data straight out of the input buffer and into the output buffer in full-duplex mode. In
   playback-only mode, pInput will be null. Likewise, pOutput will be null in capture-only mode. The sample count is no longer
   returned from the callback since it's not necessary for miniaudio anymore.

2) The device config needed to change in order to support full-duplex. Full-duplex requires the ability to allow the client
   to choose a different PCM format for the playback and capture sides. The old ma_device_config object simply did not allow
   this and needed to change. With these changes you now specify the device ID, format, channels, channel map and share mode
   on a per-playback and per-capture basis (see example below). The sample rate must be the same for playback and capture.

   Since the device config API has changed I have also decided to take the opportunity to simplify device initialization. Now,
   the device ID, device type and callback user data are set in the config. ma_device_init() is now simplified down to taking
   just the context, device config and a pointer to the device object being initialized. The rationale for this change is that
   it just makes more sense to me that these are set as part of the config like everything else.

   Example device initialization:

       ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_duplex);   // Or ma_device_type_playback or ma_device_type_capture.
       config.playback.pDeviceID = &myPlaybackDeviceID; // Or NULL for the default playback device.
       config.playback.format    = ma_format_f32;
       config.playback.channels  = 2;
       config.capture.pDeviceID  = &myCaptureDeviceID;  // Or NULL for the default capture device.
       config.capture.format     = ma_format_s16;
       config.capture.channels   = 1;
       config.sampleRate         = 44100;
       config.dataCallback       = data_callback;
       config.pUserData          = &myUserData;

       result = ma_device_init(&myContext, &config, &device);
       if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
           ... handle error ...
       }

   Note that the "onDataCallback" member of ma_device_config has been renamed to "dataCallback". Also, "onStopCallback" has
   been renamed to "stopCallback".

This is the first pass for full-duplex and there is a known bug. You will hear crackling on the following backends when sample
rate conversion is required for the playback device:
  - Core Audio
  - JACK
  - AAudio
  - OpenSL
  - WebAudio

In addition to the above, not all platforms have been absolutely thoroughly tested simply because I lack the hardware for such
thorough testing. If you experience a bug, an issue report on GitHub or an email would be greatly appreciated (and a sample
program that reproduces the issue if possible).


Other API Changes
-----------------
In addition to the above, the following API changes have been made:

- The log callback is no longer passed to ma_context_config_init(). Instead you need to set it manually after initialization.
- The onLogCallback member of ma_context_config has been renamed to "logCallback".
- The log callback now takes a logLevel parameter. The new callback looks like: void log_callback(ma_context* pContext, ma_device* pDevice, ma_uint32 logLevel, const char* message)
  - You can use ma_log_level_to_string() to convert the logLevel to human readable text if you want to log it.
- Some APIs have been renamed:
  - mal_decoder_read()          -> ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames()
  - mal_decoder_seek_to_frame() -> ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame()
  - mal_sine_wave_read()        -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32()
  - mal_sine_wave_read_ex()     -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32_ex()
- Some APIs have been removed:
  - mal_device_get_buffer_size_in_bytes()
  - mal_device_set_recv_callback()
  - mal_device_set_send_callback()
  - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate()
  - mal_src_set_output_sample_rate()
- Error codes have been rearranged. If you're a binding maintainer you will need to update.
- The ma_backend enums have been rearranged to priority order. The rationale for this is to simplify automatic backend selection
  and to make it easier to see the priority. If you're a binding maintainer you will need to update.
- ma_dsp has been renamed to ma_pcm_converter. The rationale for this change is that I'm expecting "ma_dsp" to conflict with
  some future planned high-level APIs.
- For functions that take a pointer/count combo, such as ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(), the parameter order has changed so that
  the pointer comes before the count. The rationale for this is to keep it consistent with things like memcpy().


Miscellaneous Changes
---------------------
The following miscellaneous changes have also been made.

- The AAudio backend has been added for Android 8 and above. This is Android's new "High-Performance Audio" API. (For the
  record, this is one of the nicest audio APIs out there, just behind the BSD audio APIs).
- The WebAudio backend has been added. This is based on ScriptProcessorNode. This removes the need for SDL.
- The SDL and OpenAL backends have been removed. These were originally implemented to add support for platforms for which miniaudio
  was not explicitly supported. These are no longer needed and have therefore been removed.
- Device initialization now fails if the requested share mode is not supported. If you ask for exclusive mode, you either get an
  exclusive mode device, or an error. The rationale for this change is to give the client more control over how to handle cases
  when the desired shared mode is unavailable.
- A lock-free ring buffer API has been added. There are two varients of this. "ma_rb" operates on bytes, whereas "ma_pcm_rb"
  operates on PCM frames.
- The library is now licensed as a choice of Public Domain (Unlicense) _or_ MIT-0 (No Attribution) which is the same as MIT, but
  removes the attribution requirement. The rationale for this is to support countries that don't recognize public domain.

C++) and released into the public domain.

Supported Backends:
  - WASAPI
  - DirectSound
  - WinMM
  - Core Audio (Apple)
  - ALSA
  - PulseAudio
  - JACK
  - sndio (OpenBSD)

  - Signed 24-bit PCM (tightly packed)
  - Signed 32-bit PCM
  - IEEE 32-bit floating point PCM


USAGE
=====
miniaudio is a single-file library. To use it, do something like the following in one .c file.
  #define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
  #include "miniaudio.h"

You can then #include this file in other parts of the program as you would with any other header file.

miniaudio uses an asynchronous, callback based API. You initialize a device with a configuration (sample rate,
channel count, etc.) which includes the callback you want to use to handle data transmission to/from the
device. In the callback you either read from a data pointer in the case of playback or write to it in the case
of capture.

Playback Example
----------------
  void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount)
  {
      ma_decoder* pDecoder = (ma_decoder*)pDevice->pUserData;
      if (pDecoder == NULL) {
          return;
      }
  
      ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(pDecoder, frameCount, pOutput);
  }

  ...

  ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
  config.playback.format   = decoder.outputFormat;
  config.playback.channels = decoder.outputChannels;
  config.sampleRate        = decoder.outputSampleRate;
  config.dataCallback      = data_callback;
  config.pUserData         = &decoder;

  ma_device device;
  if (ma_device_init(NULL, &config, &device) != MA_SUCCESS) {
      ... An error occurred ...
  }

  ma_device_start(&device);     // The device is sleeping by default so you'll need to start it manually.

  ...

  ma_device_uninit(&device);    // This will stop the device so no need to do that manually.


BUILDING
========
miniaudio should Just Work by adding it to your project's source tree. You do not need to download or install
any dependencies. See below for platform-specific details.

If you want to disable a specific backend, #define the appropriate MA_NO_* option before the implementation.

Note that GCC and Clang requires "-msse2", "-mavx2", etc. for SIMD optimizations.


Building for Windows
--------------------
The Windows build should compile clean on all popular compilers without the need to configure any include paths
nor link to any libraries.

Building for macOS and iOS
--------------------------
The macOS build should compile clean without the need to download any dependencies or link to any libraries or
frameworks. The iOS build needs to be compiled as Objective-C (sorry) and will need to link the relevant frameworks
but should Just Work with Xcode.

Building for Linux
------------------
The Linux build only requires linking to -ldl, -lpthread and -lm. You do not need any development packages.

Building for BSD
----------------
The BSD build only requires linking to -ldl, -lpthread and -lm. NetBSD uses audio(4), OpenBSD uses sndio and
FreeBSD uses OSS.

Building for Android
--------------------
AAudio is the highest priority backend on Android. This should work out out of the box without needing any kind of
compiler configuration. Support for AAudio starts with Android 8 which means older versions will fall back to
OpenSL|ES which requires API level 16+.

Building for Emscripten
-----------------------
The Emscripten build emits Web Audio JavaScript directly and should Just Work without any configuration.


NOTES
=====
- This library uses an asynchronous API for delivering and requesting audio data. Each device will have
  it's own worker thread which is managed by the library.
- If ma_device_init() is called with a device that's not aligned to the platform's natural alignment
  boundary (4 bytes on 32-bit, 8 bytes on 64-bit), it will _not_ be thread-safe. The reason for this
  is that it depends on members of ma_device being correctly aligned for atomic assignments.
- Sample data is always native-endian and interleaved. For example, ma_format_s16 means signed 16-bit
  integer samples, interleaved. Let me know if you need non-interleaved and I'll look into it.
- The sndio backend is currently only enabled on OpenBSD builds.
- The audio(4) backend is supported on OpenBSD, but you may need to disable sndiod before you can use it.
- Automatic stream routing is enabled on a per-backend basis. Support is explicitly enabled for WASAPI
  and Core Audio, however other backends such as PulseAudio may naturally support it, though not all have
  been tested.


BACKEND NUANCES
===============

PulseAudio
----------
- If you experience bad glitching/noise on Arch Linux, consider this fix from the Arch wiki:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Glitches,_skips_or_crackling
  Alternatively, consider using a different backend such as ALSA.

Android
-------
- To capture audio on Android, remember to add the RECORD_AUDIO permission to your manifest:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
- With OpenSL|ES, only a single ma_context can be active at any given time. This is due to a limitation with OpenSL|ES.
- With AAudio, only default devices are enumerated. This is due to AAudio not having an enumeration API (devices are
  enumerated through Java). You can however perform your own device enumeration through Java and then set the ID in the
  ma_device_id structure (ma_device_id.aaudio) and pass it to ma_device_init().
- The backend API will perform resampling where possible. The reason for this as opposed to using miniaudio's built-in
  resampler is to take advantage of any potential device-specific optimizations the driver may implement.

UWP
---
- UWP only supports default playback and capture devices.
- UWP requires the Microphone capability to be enabled in the application's manifest (Package.appxmanifest):
      <Package ...>
          ...
          <Capabilities>
              <DeviceCapability Name="microphone" />
          </Capabilities>
      </Package>

Web Audio / Emscripten
----------------------
- The first time a context is initialized it will create a global object called "miniaudio" whose primary purpose is to act
  as a factory for device objects.
- Currently the Web Audio backend uses ScriptProcessorNode's, but this may need to change later as they've been deprecated.
- Google is implementing a policy in their browsers that prevent automatic media output without first receiving some kind
  of user input. See here for details: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes. Starting
  the device may fail if you try to start playback without first handling some kind of user input.

DEFINITIONS
===========
This section defines common terms used throughout miniaudio. Unfortunately there is often ambiguity in the use of terms
throughout the audio space, so this section is intended to clarify how miniaudio uses each term.

Sample
------
A sample is a single unit of audio data. If the sample format is f32, then one sample is one 32-bit floating point number.

Frame / PCM Frame
-----------------
A frame is a groups of samples equal to the number of channels. For a stereo stream a frame is 2 samples, a mono frame
is 1 sample, a 5.1 surround sound frame is 6 samples, etc. The terms "frame" and "PCM frame" are the same thing in
miniaudio. Note that this is different to a compressed frame. If ever miniaudio needs to refer to a compressed frame, such
as a FLAC frame, it will always clarify what it's referring to with something like "FLAC frame" or whatnot.

Channel
-------
A stream of monaural audio that is emitted from an individual speaker in a speaker system, or received from an individual
microphone in a microphone system. A stereo stream has two channels (a left channel, and a right channel), a 5.1 surround
sound system has 6 channels, etc. Some audio systems refer to a channel as a complex audio stream that's mixed with other
channels to produce the final mix - this is completely different to miniaudio's use of the term "channel" and should not be
confused.

Sample Rate
-----------
The sample rate in miniaudio is always expressed in Hz, such as 44100, 48000, etc. It's the number of PCM frames that are
processed per second.

Formats
-------
Throughout miniaudio you will see references to different sample formats:
    u8  - Unsigned 8-bit integer
    s16 - Signed 16-bit integer
    s24 - Signed 24-bit integer (tightly packed).
    s32 - Signed 32-bit integer
    f32 - 32-bit floating point

/************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Format Conversion
=================
The format converter serves two purposes:
  1) Conversion between data formats (u8 to f32, etc.)
  2) Interleaving and deinterleaving

When initializing a converter, you specify the input and output formats (u8, s16, etc.) and read callbacks. There are two read callbacks - one for
interleaved input data (onRead) and another for deinterleaved input data (onReadDeinterleaved). You implement whichever is most convenient for you. You
can implement both, but it's not recommended as it just introduces unnecessary complexity.

To read data as interleaved samples, use ma_format_converter_read(). Otherwise use ma_format_converter_read_deinterleaved().

Dithering
---------
The format converter also supports dithering. Dithering can be set using ditherMode variable in the config, like so.

  pConfig->ditherMode = ma_dither_mode_rectangle;

The different dithering modes include the following, in order of efficiency:
  - None:      ma_dither_mode_none
  - Rectangle: ma_dither_mode_rectangle
  - Triangle:  ma_dither_mode_triangle

Note that even if the dither mode is set to something other than ma_dither_mode_none, it will be ignored for conversions where dithering is not needed.
Dithering is available for the following conversions:
  - s16 -> u8
  - s24 -> u8
  - s32 -> u8
  - f32 -> u8
  - s24 -> s16
  - s32 -> s16
  - f32 -> s16

Note that it is not an error to pass something other than ma_dither_mode_none for conversions where dither is not used. It will just be ignored.

/************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Channel Routing
===============
There are two main things you can do with the channel router:
  1) Rearrange channels
  2) Convert from one channel count to another

Channel Rearrangement
---------------------
A simple example of channel rearrangement may be swapping the left and right channels in a stereo stream. To do this you just pass in the same channel
count for both the input and output with channel maps that contain the same channels (in a different order).

Channel Conversion
------------------
The channel router can also convert from one channel count to another, such as converting a 5.1 stream to stero. When changing the channel count, the
router will first perform a 1:1 mapping of channel positions that are present in both the input and output channel maps. The second thing it will do
is distribute the input mono channel (if any) across all output channels, excluding any None and LFE channels. If there is an output mono channel, all
input channels will be averaged, excluding any None and LFE channels.

The last case to consider is when a channel position in the input channel map is not present in the output channel map, and vice versa. In this case the
channel router will perform a blend of other related channels to produce an audible channel. There are several blending modes.
  1) Simple
     Unmatched channels are silenced.
  2) Planar Blending
     Channels are blended based on a set of planes that each speaker emits audio from.

Rectangular / Planar Blending
-----------------------------
In this mode, channel positions are associated with a set of planes where the channel conceptually emits audio from. An example is the front/left speaker.
This speaker is positioned to the front of the listener, so you can think of it as emitting audio from the front plane. It is also positioned to the left
of the listener so you can think of it as also emitting audio from the left plane. Now consider the (unrealistic) situation where the input channel map
contains only the front/left channel position, but the output channel map contains both the front/left and front/center channel. When deciding on the audio
data to send to the front/center speaker (which has no 1:1 mapping with an input channel) we need to use some logic based on our available input channel
positions.

As mentioned earlier, our front/left speaker is, conceptually speaking, emitting audio from the front _and_ the left planes. Similarly, the front/center
speaker is emitting audio from _only_ the front plane. What these two channels have in common is that they are both emitting audio from the front plane.
Thus, it makes sense that the front/center speaker should receive some contribution from the front/left channel. How much contribution depends on their
planar relationship (thus the name of this blending technique).

Because the front/left channel is emitting audio from two planes (front and left), you can think of it as though it's willing to dedicate 50% of it's total
volume to each of it's planes (a channel position emitting from 1 plane would be willing to given 100% of it's total volume to that plane, and a channel
position emitting from 3 planes would be willing to given 33% of it's total volume to each plane). Similarly, the front/center speaker is emitting audio
from only one plane so you can think of it as though it's willing to _take_ 100% of it's volume from front plane emissions. Now, since the front/left
channel is willing to _give_ 50% of it's total volume to the front plane, and the front/center speaker is willing to _take_ 100% of it's total volume
from the front, you can imagine that 50% of the front/left speaker will be given to the front/center speaker.

Usage
-----
To use the channel router you need to specify three things:
  1) The input channel count and channel map
  2) The output channel count and channel map
  3) The mixing mode to use in the case where a 1:1 mapping is unavailable

Note that input and output data is always deinterleaved 32-bit floating point.

Initialize the channel router with ma_channel_router_init(). You will need to pass in a config object which specifies the input and output configuration,
mixing mode and a callback for sending data to the router. This callback will be called when input data needs to be sent to the router for processing. Note
that the mixing mode is only used when a 1:1 mapping is unavailable. This includes the custom weights mode.

Read data from the channel router with ma_channel_router_read_deinterleaved(). Output data is always 32-bit floating point.

/************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Ring Buffer
===========

Features
--------
- Lock free (assuming single producer, single consumer)
- Support for interleaved and deinterleaved streams
- Allows the caller to allocate their own block of memory

Usage
-----
- Call ma_rb_init() to initialize a simple buffer, with an optional pre-allocated buffer. If you pass in NULL
  for the pre-allocated buffer, it will be allocated for you and free()'d in ma_rb_uninit(). If you pass in
  your own pre-allocated buffer, free()-ing is left to you.

- Call ma_rb_init_ex() if you need a deinterleaved buffer. The data for each sub-buffer is offset from each
  other based on the stride. Use ma_rb_get_subbuffer_stride(), ma_rb_get_subbuffer_offset() and
  ma_rb_get_subbuffer_ptr() to manage your sub-buffers.

- Use ma_rb_acquire_read() and ma_rb_acquire_write() to retrieve a pointer to a section of the ring buffer.
  You specify the number of bytes you need, and on output it will set to what was actually acquired. If the
  read or write pointer is positioned such that the number of bytes requested will require a loop, it will be
  clamped to the end of the buffer. Therefore, the number of bytes you're given may be less than the number
  you requested.

- After calling ma_rb_acquire_read/write(), you do your work on the buffer and then "commit" it with
  ma_rb_commit_read/write(). This is where the read/write pointers are updated. When you commit you need to
  pass in the buffer that was returned by the earlier call to ma_rb_acquire_read/write() and is only used
  for validation. The number of bytes passed to ma_rb_commit_read/write() is what's used to increment the
  pointers.

- If you want to correct for drift between the write pointer and the read pointer you can use a combination
  of ma_rb_pointer_distance(), ma_rb_seek_read() and ma_rb_seek_write(). Note that you can only move the
  pointers forward, and you should only move the read pointer forward via the consumer thread, and the write
  pointer forward by the producer thread. If there is too much space between the pointers, move the read
  pointer forward. If there is too little space between the pointers, move the write pointer forward.


Notes
-----
- Thread safety depends on a single producer, single consumer model. Only one thread is allowed to write, and
  only one thread is allowed to read. The producer is the only one allowed to move the write pointer, and the
  consumer is the only one allowed to move the read pointer.
- Operates on bytes. Use ma_pcm_rb to operate in terms of PCM frames.
- Maximum buffer size in bytes is 0x7FFFFFFF-(MA_SIMD_ALIGNMENT-1) because of reasons.

This is the same as the regular ring buffer, except that it works on PCM frames instead of bytes.

pOutput is a pointer to a buffer that will receive audio data that will later be played back through the speakers. This will be non-null
for a playback or full-duplex device and null for a capture device.

pInput is a pointer to a buffer containing input data from the device. This will be non-null for a capture or full-duplex device, and
null for a playback device.

frameCount is the number of PCM frames to process. If an output buffer is provided (pOutput is not null), applications should write out

you'll get.

/*
Initializes a context.

The context is used for selecting and initializing the relevant backends.

Note that the location of the context cannot change throughout it's lifetime. Consider allocating
the ma_context object with malloc() if this is an issue. The reason for this is that a pointer
to the context is stored in the ma_device structure.

<backends> is used to allow the application to prioritize backends depending on it's specific
requirements. This can be null in which case it uses the default priority, which is as follows:
  - WASAPI
  - DirectSound
  - WinMM
  - Core Audio (Apple)
  - sndio
  - audio(4)
  - OSS
  - PulseAudio
  - ALSA
  - JACK
  - AAudio
  - OpenSL|ES
  - Web Audio / Emscripten
  - Null

<pConfig> is used to configure the context. Use the logCallback config to set a callback for whenever a
log message is posted. The priority of the worker thread can be set with the threadPriority config.

It is recommended that only a single context is active at any given time because it's a bulky data
structure which performs run-time linking for the relevant backends every time it's initialized.

This is a lower-level enumeration function to the easier to use ma_context_get_devices(). Use

it simply suits your code better.

Do _not_ assume the first enumerated device of a given type is the default device.

Some backends and platforms may only support default playback and capture devices.

Note that this only retrieves the ID and name/description of the device. The reason for only
retrieving basic information is that it would otherwise require opening the backend device in
order to probe it for more detailed information which can be inefficient. Consider using
ma_context_get_device_info() for this, but don't call it from within the enumeration callback.

In general, you should not do anything complicated from within the callback. In particular, do
not try initializing a device from within the callback.

Consider using ma_context_get_devices() for a simpler and safer API, albeit at the expense of
an internal heap allocation.

Returning false from the callback will stop enumeration. Returning true will continue enumeration.

floating point samples for mixing, but in exclusive mode it can be anything. Therefore, this
function allows you to specify which share mode you want information for. Note that not all
backends and devices support shared or exclusive mode, in which case this function will fail
if the requested share mode is unsupported.

/*
Initializes a device.

The context can be null in which case it uses the default. This is equivalent to passing in a
context that was initialized like so:

    ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);

Do not pass in null for the context if you are needing to open multiple devices. You can,
however, use null when initializing the first device, and then use device.pContext for the
initialization of other devices.

The device's configuration is controlled with pConfig. This allows you to configure the sample
format, channel count, sample rate, etc. Before calling ma_device_init(), you will need to
initialize a ma_device_config object using ma_device_config_init(). You must set the callback in
the device config. Once initialized, the device's config is immutable. If you need to change the
config you will need to initialize a new device.

Passing in 0 to any property in pConfig will force the use of a default value. In the case of
sample format, channel count, sample rate and channel map it will default to the values used by
the backend's internal device. For the size of the buffer you can set bufferSizeInFrames or
bufferSizeInMilliseconds (if both are set it will prioritize bufferSizeInFrames). If both are
set to zero, it will default to MA_BASE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_LOW_LATENCY or
MA_BASE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_CONSERVATIVE, depending on whether or not performanceProfile
is set to ma_performance_profile_low_latency or ma_performance_profile_conservative.

If you request exclusive mode and the backend does not support it an error will be returned. For
robustness, you may want to first try initializing the device in exclusive mode, and then fall back
to shared mode if required. Alternatively you can just request shared mode (the default if you
leave it unset in the config) which is the most reliable option. Some backends do not have a
practical way of choosing whether or not the device should be exclusive or not (ALSA, for example)
in which case it just acts as a hint. Unless you have special requirements you should try avoiding
exclusive mode as it's intrusive to the user. Starting with Windows 10, miniaudio will use low-latency
shared mode where possible which may make exclusive mode unnecessary.

When sending or receiving data to/from a device, miniaudio will internally perform a format
conversion to convert between the format specified by pConfig and the format used internally by
the backend. If you pass in NULL for pConfig or 0 for the sample format, channel count,
sample rate _and_ channel map, data transmission will run on an optimized pass-through fast path.

The buffer size should be treated as a hint. miniaudio will try it's best to use exactly what you
ask for, but it may differ. You should not assume the number of frames specified in each call to
the data callback is exactly what you originally specified.

The <periods> property controls how frequently the background thread is woken to check for more
data. It's tied to the buffer size, so as an example, if your buffer size is equivalent to 10
milliseconds and you have 2 periods, the CPU will wake up approximately every 5 milliseconds.

When compiling for UWP you must ensure you call this function on the main UI thread because the
operating system may need to present the user with a message asking for permissions. Please refer
to the official documentation for ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync() for more information.

ALSA Specific: When initializing the default device, requesting shared mode will try using the
"dmix" device for playback and the "dsnoop" device for capture. If these fail it will try falling
back to the "hw" device.

Return Value:
  MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.

Thread Safety: UNSAFE

  depend on and mutate global state (such as OpenSL|ES). The same applies to calling this at the
  same time as ma_device_uninit().

to be done _before_ the device begins playback.

This API needs to wait on the worker thread to stop the backend device properly before returning. It
also waits on a mutex for thread-safety. In addition, some backends need to wait for the device to
finish playback/recording of the current fragment which can take some time (usually proportionate to
the buffer size that was specified at initialization time).

This should not drop unprocessed samples. Backends are required to either pause the stream in-place
or drain the buffer if pausing is not possible. The reason for this is that stopping the device and
the resuming it with ma_device_start() (which you might do when your program loses focus) may result
in a situation where those samples are never output to the speakers or received from the microphone
which can in turn result in de-syncs.

/*
Helper function for initializing a ma_context_config object.
*/
ma_context_config ma_context_config_init(void);

/*
Initializes a device config.

By default, the device config will use native device settings (format, channels, sample rate, etc.). Using native
settings means you will get an optimized pass-through data transmission pipeline to and from the device, but you will
need to do all format conversions manually. Normally you would want to use a known format that your program can handle
natively, which you can do by specifying it after this function returns, like so:

    ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
    config.callback = my_data_callback;
    config.pUserData = pMyUserData;
    config.format = ma_format_f32;
    config.channels = 2;
    config.sampleRate = 44100;

In this case miniaudio will perform all of the necessary data conversion for you behind the scenes.

Currently miniaudio only supports asynchronous, callback based data delivery which means you must specify callback. A
pointer to user data can also be specified which is set in the pUserData member of the ma_device object.

To specify a channel map you can use ma_get_standard_channel_map():

    ma_get_standard_channel_map(ma_standard_channel_map_default, config.channels, config.channelMap);

Alternatively you can set the channel map manually if you need something specific or something that isn't one of miniaudio's
stock channel maps.

By default the system's default device will be used. Set the pDeviceID member to a pointer to a ma_device_id object to 
use a specific device. You can enumerate over the devices with ma_context_enumerate_devices() or ma_context_get_devices()
which will give you access to the device ID. Set pDeviceID to NULL to use the default device.

The device type can be one of the ma_device_type's:
  ma_device_type_playback
  ma_device_type_capture
  ma_device_type_duplex

Unfortunately using runtime linking for pthreads causes problems. This has occurred for me when testing on FreeBSD. When
using runtime linking, deadlocks can occur (for me it happens when loading data from fread()). It turns out that doing
compile-time linking fixes this. I'm not sure why this happens, but the safest way I can think of to fix this is to simply
disable runtime linking by default. To enable runtime linking, #define this before the implementation of this file. I am
not officially supporting this, but I'm leaving it here in case it's useful for somebody, somewhere.

    situation where the names of the devices are truncated. To help work around this, we need to look at the name GUID and try
    looking in the registry for the full name. If we can't find it there, we need to just fall back to the default name.

    Now try the registry. There's a few things to consider here:
    - The name GUID can be null, in which we case we just need to stick to the original 31 characters.
    - If the name GUID is not present in the registry we'll also need to stick to the original 31 characters.
    - I like consistency, so I want the returned device names to be consistent with those returned by WASAPI and DirectSound. The
      problem, however is that WASAPI and DirectSound use "<component> (<name>)" format (such as "Speakers (High Definition Audio)"),
      but WinMM does not specificy the component name. From my admittedly limited testing, I've notice the component name seems to
      usually fit within the 31 characters of the fixed sized buffer, so what I'm going to do is parse that string for the component
      name, and then concatenate the name from the registry.

        an ID of this format is specified, it indicates to miniaudio that it can try different combinations of plugins ("hw", "dmix", etc.) until it
        finds an appropriate one that works. This comes in very handy when trying to open a device in shared mode ("dmix"), vs exclusive mode ("hw").

        It appears there's either a bug in ALSA, a bug in some drivers, or I'm doing something silly; but having resampling enabled causes
        problems with some device configurations when used in conjunction with MMAP access mode. To fix this problem we need to disable
        resampling.
        
        To reproduce this problem, open the "plug:dmix" device, and set the sample rate to 44100. Internally, it looks like dmix uses a
        sample rate of 48000. The hardware parameters will get set correctly with no errors, but it looks like the 44100 -> 48000 resampling
        doesn't work properly - but only with MMAP access mode. You will notice skipping/crackling in the audio, and it'll run at a slightly
        faster rate.
        
        miniaudio has built-in support for sample rate conversion (albeit low quality at the moment), so disabling resampling should be fine
        for us. The only problem is that it won't be taking advantage of any kind of hardware-accelerated resampling and it won't be very
        good quality until I get a chance to improve the quality of miniaudio's software sample rate conversion.
        
        I don't currently know if the dmix plugin is the only one with this error. Indeed, this is the only one I've been able to reproduce
        this error with. In the future, we may want to restrict the disabling of resampling to only known bad plugins.

Core Audio

So far, Core Audio has been the worst backend to work with due to being both unintuitive and having almost no documentation
apart from comments in the headers (which admittedly are quite good). For my own purposes, and for anybody out there whose
needing to figure out how this darn thing works, I'm going to outline a few things here.

Since miniaudio is a fairly low-level API, one of the things it needs is control over specific devices, and it needs to be
able to identify whether or not it can be used as playback and/or capture. The AudioObject API is the only one I've seen
that supports this level of detail. There was some public domain sample code I stumbled across that used the AudioComponent
and AudioUnit APIs, but I couldn't see anything that gave low-level control over device selection and capabilities (the
distinction between playback and capture in particular). Therefore, miniaudio is using the AudioObject API.

Most (all?) functions in the AudioObject API take a AudioObjectID as it's input. This is the device identifier. When
retrieving global information, such as the device list, you use kAudioObjectSystemObject. When retrieving device-specific
data, you pass in the ID for that device. In order to retrieve device-specific IDs you need to enumerate over each of the
devices. This is done using the AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() and AudioObjectGetPropertyData() APIs which seem to be
the central APIs for retrieving information about the system and specific devices.

To use the AudioObjectGetPropertyData() API you need to use the notion of a property address. A property address is a
structure with three variables and is used to identify which property you are getting or setting. The first is the "selector"
which is basically the specific property that you're wanting to retrieve or set. The second is the "scope", which is
typically set to kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal, kAudioObjectPropertyScopeInput for input-specific properties and
kAudioObjectPropertyScopeOutput for output-specific properties. The last is the "element" which is always set to
kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster in miniaudio's case. I don't know of any cases where this would be set to anything different.

Back to the earlier issue of device retrieval, you first use the AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() API to retrieve the size
of the raw data which is just a list of AudioDeviceID's. You use the kAudioObjectSystemObject AudioObjectID, and a property
address with the kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices selector and the kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal scope. Once you have the
size, allocate a block of memory of that size and then call AudioObjectGetPropertyData(). The data is just a list of
AudioDeviceID's so just do "dataSize/sizeof(AudioDeviceID)" to know the device count.

        Both playback and capture devices use a ScriptProcessorNode for performing per-sample operations.

        ScriptProcessorNode is actually deprecated so this is likely to be temporary. The way this works for playback is very simple. You just set a callback
        that's periodically fired, just like a normal audio callback function. But apparently this design is "flawed" and is now deprecated in favour of
        something called AudioWorklets which _forces_ you to load a _separate_ .js file at run time... nice... Hopefully ScriptProcessorNode will continue to
        work for years to come, but this may need to change to use AudioSourceBufferNode instead, which I think is what Emscripten uses for it's built-in SDL
        implementation. I'll be avoiding that insane AudioWorklet API like the plague...

        For capture it is a bit unintuitive. We use the ScriptProccessorNode _only_ to get the raw PCM data. It is connected to an AudioContext just like the
        playback case, however we just output silence to the AudioContext instead of passing any real data. It would make more sense to me to use the
        MediaRecorder API, but unfortunately you need to specify a MIME time (Opus, Vorbis, etc.) for the binary blob that's returned to the client, but I've
        been unable to figure out how to get this as raw PCM. The closes I can think is to use the MIME type for WAV files and just parse it, but I don't know
        how well this would work. Although ScriptProccessorNode is deprecated, in practice it seems to have pretty good browser support so I'm leaving it like
        this for now. If anything knows how I could get raw PCM data using the MediaRecorder API please let me know!

    Imagine the following simplified example: You have a single input speaker which is the front/left speaker which you want to convert to
    the following output configuration:
    
     - front/left
     - side/left
     - back/left
    
    The front/left output is easy - it the same speaker position so it receives the full contribution of the front/left input. The amount
    of contribution to apply to the side/left and back/left speakers, however, is a bit more complicated.
    
    Imagine the front/left speaker as emitting audio from two planes - the front plane and the left plane. You can think of the front/left
    speaker emitting half of it's total volume from the front, and the other half from the left. Since part of it's volume is being emitted
    from the left side, and the side/left and back/left channels also emit audio from the left plane, one would expect that they would
    receive some amount of contribution from front/left speaker. The amount of contribution depends on how many planes are shared between
    the two speakers. Note that in the examples below I've added a top/front/left speaker as an example just to show how the math works
    across 3 spatial dimensions.
    
    The first thing to do is figure out how each speaker's volume is spread over each of plane:
     - front/left:     2 planes (front and left)      = 1/2 = half it's total volume on each plane
     - side/left:      1 plane (left only)            = 1/1 = entire volume from left plane

Sinc Sample Rate Conversion
===========================

The sinc SRC algorithm uses a windowed sinc to perform interpolation of samples. Currently, miniaudio's implementation supports rectangular and Hann window
methods.

Whenever an output sample is being computed, it looks at a sub-section of the input samples. I've called this sub-section in the code below the "window",
which I realize is a bit ambigous with the mathematical "window", but it works for me when I need to conceptualize things in my head. The window is made up
of two halves. The first half contains past input samples (initialized to zero), and the second half contains future input samples. As time moves forward
and input samples are consumed, the window moves forward. The larger the window, the better the quality at the expense of slower processing. The window is
limited the range [MA_SRC_SINC_MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH, MA_SRC_SINC_MAX_WINDOW_WIDTH] and defaults to MA_SRC_SINC_DEFAULT_WINDOW_WIDTH.

Input samples are cached for efficiency (to prevent frequently requesting tiny numbers of samples from the client). When the window gets to the end of the
cache, it's moved back to the start, and more samples are read from the client. If the client has no more data to give, the cache is filled with zeros and
the last of the input samples will be consumed. Once the last of the input samples have been consumed, no more samples will be output.


When reading output samples, we always first read whatever is already in the input cache. Only when the cache has been fully consumed do we read more data
from the client.

To access samples in the input buffer you do so relative to the window. When the window itself is at position 0, the first item in the buffer is accessed
with "windowPos + windowWidth". Generally, to access any sample relative to the window you do "windowPos + windowWidth + sampleIndexRelativeToWindow".

    In general, this is the pipeline used for data conversion. Note that this can actually change which is explained later.
    
      Pre Format Conversion -> Sample Rate Conversion -> Channel Routing -> Post Format Conversion
    
    Pre Format Conversion
    ---------------------
    This is where the sample data is converted to a format that's usable by the later stages in the pipeline. Input data
    is converted to deinterleaved floating-point.
    
    Channel Routing
    ---------------
    Channel routing is where stereo is converted to 5.1, mono is converted to stereo, etc. This stage depends on the
    pre format conversion stage.
    
    Sample Rate Conversion
    ----------------------
    Sample rate conversion depends on the pre format conversion stage and as the name implies performs sample rate conversion.
    
    Post Format Conversion
    ----------------------
    This stage is where our deinterleaved floating-point data from the previous stages are converted to the requested output
    format.
    
    
    Optimizations
    -------------
    Sometimes the conversion pipeline is rearranged for efficiency. The first obvious optimization is to eliminate unnecessary
    stages in the pipeline. When no channel routing nor sample rate conversion is necessary, the entire pipeline is optimized
    down to just this:
    
      Post Format Conversion
    
    When sample rate conversion is not unnecessary:
    
      Pre Format Conversion -> Channel Routing -> Post Format Conversion
    
    When channel routing is unnecessary:
    
      Pre Format Conversion -> Sample Rate Conversion -> Post Format Conversion
    
    A slightly less obvious optimization is used depending on whether or not we are increasing or decreasing the number of
    channels. Because everything in the pipeline works on a per-channel basis, the efficiency of the pipeline is directly
    proportionate to the number of channels that need to be processed. Therefore, it's can be more efficient to move the
    channel conversion stage to an earlier or later stage. When the channel count is being reduced, we move the channel
    conversion stage to the start of the pipeline so that later stages can work on a smaller number of channels at a time.
    Otherwise, we move the channel conversion stage to the end of the pipeline. When reducing the channel count, the pipeline
    will look like this:
    
      Pre Format Conversion -> Channel Routing -> Sample Rate Conversion -> Post Format Conversion
    
    Notice how the Channel Routing and Sample Rate Conversion stages are swapped so that the SRC stage has less data to process.

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDLINES
================================
Context
-------
- Run-time linking if possible.
- Set whether or not it's an asynchronous backend

Device
------
- If a full-duplex device is requested and the backend does not support full duplex devices, have ma_device_init__[backend]()
  return MA_DEVICE_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED.
- If exclusive mode is requested, but the backend does not support it, return MA_SHARE_MODE_NOT_SUPPORTED. If practical, try
  not to fall back to a different share mode - give the client exactly what they asked for. Some backends, such as ALSA, may
  not have a practical way to distinguish between the two.
- If pDevice->usingDefault* is set, prefer the device's native value if the backend supports it. Otherwise use the relevant
  value from the config.
- If the configs buffer size in frames is 0, set it based on the buffer size in milliseconds, keeping in mind to handle the
  case when the default sample rate is being used where practical.
- Backends must set the following members of pDevice before returning successfully from ma_device_init__[backend]():
  - internalFormat
  - internalChannels
  - internalSampleRate
  - internalChannelMap
  - bufferSizeInFrames
  - periods

/*
REVISION HISTORY
================
v0.9.6 - 2019-08-04
  - Add support for loading decoders using a wchar_t string for file paths.
  - Don't trigger an assert when ma_device_start() is called on a device that is already started. This will now log a warning
    and return MA_INVALID_OPERATION. The same applies for ma_device_stop().
  - Try fixing an issue with PulseAudio taking a long time to start playback.
  - Fix a bug in ma_convert_frames() and ma_convert_frames_ex().
  - Fix memory leaks in the WASAPI backend.
  - Fix a compilation error with Visual Studio 2010.

v0.9.5 - 2019-05-21
  - Add logging to ma_dlopen() and ma_dlsym().
  - Add ma_decoder_get_length_in_pcm_frames().
  - Fix a bug with capture on the OpenSL|ES backend.
  - Fix a bug with the ALSA backend where a device would not restart after being stopped.

v0.9.4 - 2019-05-06
  - Add support for C89. With this change, miniaudio should compile clean with GCC/Clang with "-std=c89 -ansi -pedantic" and
    Microsoft compilers back to VC6. Other compilers should also work, but have not been tested.

v0.9.3 - 2019-04-19
  - Fix compiler errors on GCC when compiling with -std=c99.

v0.9.2 - 2019-04-08
  - Add support for per-context user data.
  - Fix a potential bug with context configs.
  - Fix some bugs with PulseAudio.

v0.9.1 - 2019-03-17
  - Fix a bug where the output buffer is not getting zeroed out before calling the data callback. This happens when
    the device is running in passthrough mode (not doing any data conversion).
  - Fix an issue where the data callback is getting called too frequently on the WASAPI and DirectSound backends.
  - Fix error on the UWP build.
  - Fix a build error on Apple platforms.

v0.9 - 2019-03-06
  - Rebranded to "miniaudio". All namespaces have been renamed from "mal" to "ma".
  - API CHANGE: ma_device_init() and ma_device_config_init() have changed significantly:
    - The device type, device ID and user data pointer have moved from ma_device_init() to the config.
    - All variations of ma_device_config_init_*() have been removed in favor of just ma_device_config_init().
    - ma_device_config_init() now takes only one parameter which is the device type. All other properties need
      to be set on the returned object directly.
    - The onDataCallback and onStopCallback members of ma_device_config have been renamed to "dataCallback"
      and "stopCallback".
    - The ID of the physical device is now split into two: one for the playback device and the other for the
      capture device. This is required for full-duplex. These are named "pPlaybackDeviceID" and "pCaptureDeviceID".
  - API CHANGE: The data callback has changed. It now uses a unified callback for all device types rather than
    being separate for each. It now takes two pointers - one containing input data and the other output data. This
    design in required for full-duplex. The return value is now void instead of the number of frames written. The
    new callback looks like the following:
        void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount);
  - API CHANGE: Remove the log callback parameter from ma_context_config_init(). With this change,
    ma_context_config_init() now takes no parameters and the log callback is set via the structure directly. The
    new policy for config initialization is that only mandatory settings are passed in to *_config_init(). The
    "onLog" member of ma_context_config has been renamed to "logCallback".
  - API CHANGE: Remove ma_device_get_buffer_size_in_bytes().
  - API CHANGE: Rename decoding APIs to "pcm_frames" convention.
    - mal_decoder_read()          -> ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames()
    - mal_decoder_seek_to_frame() -> ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame()
  - API CHANGE: Rename sine wave reading APIs to f32 convention.
    - mal_sine_wave_read()    -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32()
    - mal_sine_wave_read_ex() -> ma_sine_wave_read_f32_ex()
  - API CHANGE: Remove some deprecated APIs
    - mal_device_set_recv_callback()
    - mal_device_set_send_callback()
    - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate()
    - mal_src_set_output_sample_rate()
  - API CHANGE: Add log level to the log callback. New signature:
    - void on_log(ma_context* pContext, ma_device* pDevice, ma_uint32 logLevel, const char* message)
  - API CHANGE: Changes to result codes. Constants have changed and unused codes have been removed. If you're
    a binding mainainer you will need to update your result code constants.
  - API CHANGE: Change the order of the ma_backend enums to priority order. If you are a binding maintainer, you
    will need to update.
  - API CHANGE: Rename mal_dsp to ma_pcm_converter. All functions have been renamed from mal_dsp_*() to
    ma_pcm_converter_*(). All structures have been renamed from mal_dsp* to ma_pcm_converter*.
  - API CHANGE: Reorder parameters of ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames() to be consistent with the new parameter order scheme.
  - The resampling algorithm has been changed from sinc to linear. The rationale for this is that the sinc implementation
    is too inefficient right now. This will hopefully be improved at a later date.
  - Device initialization will no longer fall back to shared mode if exclusive mode is requested but is unusable.
    With this change, if you request an device in exclusive mode, but exclusive mode is not supported, it will not
    automatically fall back to shared mode. The client will need to reinitialize the device in shared mode if that's
    what they want.
  - Add ring buffer API. This is ma_rb and ma_pcm_rb, the difference being that ma_rb operates on bytes and
    ma_pcm_rb operates on PCM frames.
  - Add Web Audio backend. This is used when compiling with Emscripten. The SDL backend, which was previously
    used for web support, will be removed in a future version.
  - Add AAudio backend (Android Audio). This is the new priority backend for Android. Support for AAudio starts
    with Android 8. OpenSL|ES is used as a fallback for older versions of Android.
  - Remove OpenAL and SDL backends.
  - Fix a possible deadlock when rapidly stopping the device after it has started.
  - Update documentation.
  - Change licensing to a choice of public domain _or_ MIT-0 (No Attribution).

v0.8.14 - 2018-12-16
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug where the device state is not set correctly after stopping.
  - Add support for custom weights to the channel router.
  - Update decoders to use updated APIs in dr_flac, dr_mp3 and dr_wav.

v0.8.13 - 2018-12-04
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug with channel mapping.
  - Fix a bug with channel routing where the back/left and back/right channels have the wrong weight.

v0.8.12 - 2018-11-27
  - Drop support for SDL 1.2. The Emscripten build now requires "-s USE_SDL=2".
  - Fix a linking error with ALSA.
  - Fix a bug on iOS where the device name is not set correctly.

v0.8.11 - 2018-11-21
  - iOS bug fixes.
  - Minor tweaks to PulseAudio.

v0.8.10 - 2018-10-21

v0.8.9 - 2018-09-28
  - Fix a bug with the SDL backend where device initialization fails.

v0.8.8 - 2018-09-14
  - Fix Linux build with the ALSA backend.
  - Minor documentation fix.

v0.8.7 - 2018-09-12
  - Fix a bug with UWP detection.

v0.8.6 - 2018-08-26
  - Automatically switch the internal device when the default device is unplugged. Note that this is still in the
    early stages and not all backends handle this the same way. As of this version, this will not detect a default
    device switch when changed from the operating system's audio preferences (unless the backend itself handles
    this automatically). This is not supported in exclusive mode.
  - WASAPI and Core Audio: Add support for stream routing. When the application is using a default device and the
    user switches the default device via the operating system's audio preferences, miniaudio will automatically switch
    the internal device to the new default. This is not supported in exclusive mode.
  - WASAPI: Add support for hardware offloading via IAudioClient2. Only supported on Windows 8 and newer.
  - WASAPI: Add support for low-latency shared mode via IAudioClient3. Only supported on Windows 10 and newer.
  - Add support for compiling the UWP build as C.
  - mal_device_set_recv_callback() and mal_device_set_send_callback() have been deprecated. You must now set this
    when the device is initialized with mal_device_init*(). These will be removed in version 0.9.0.

v0.8.5 - 2018-08-12
  - Add support for specifying the size of a device's buffer in milliseconds. You can still set the buffer size in
    frames if that suits you. When bufferSizeInFrames is 0, bufferSizeInMilliseconds will be used. If both are non-0
    then bufferSizeInFrames will take priority. If both are set to 0 the default buffer size is used.
  - Add support for the audio(4) backend to OpenBSD.
  - Fix a bug with the ALSA backend that was causing problems on Raspberry Pi. This significantly improves the
    Raspberry Pi experience.
  - Fix a bug where an incorrect number of samples is returned from sinc resampling.
  - Add support for setting the value to be passed to internal calls to CoInitializeEx().
  - WASAPI and WinMM: Stop the device when it is unplugged.

v0.8.4 - 2018-08-06
  - Add sndio backend for OpenBSD.
  - Add audio(4) backend for NetBSD.
  - Drop support for the OSS backend on everything except FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD.
  - Formats are now native-endian (were previously little-endian).
  - Mark some APIs as deprecated:
    - mal_src_set_input_sample_rate() and mal_src_set_output_sample_rate() are replaced with mal_src_set_sample_rate().
    - mal_dsp_set_input_sample_rate() and mal_dsp_set_output_sample_rate() are replaced with mal_dsp_set_sample_rate().
  - Fix a bug when capturing using the WASAPI backend.
  - Fix some aliasing issues with resampling, specifically when increasing the sample rate.
  - Fix warnings.

v0.8.3 - 2018-07-15
  - Fix a crackling bug when resampling in capture mode.
  - Core Audio: Fix a bug where capture does not work.
  - ALSA: Fix a bug where the worker thread can get stuck in an infinite loop.
  - PulseAudio: Fix a bug where mal_context_init() succeeds when PulseAudio is unusable.
  - JACK: Fix a bug where mal_context_init() succeeds when JACK is unusable.

v0.8.2 - 2018-07-07
  - Fix a bug on macOS with Core Audio where the internal callback is not called.

v0.8.1 - 2018-07-06
  - Fix compilation errors and warnings.

v0.8 - 2018-07-05
  - Changed MA_IMPLEMENTATION to MINI_AL_IMPLEMENTATION for consistency with other libraries. The old
    way is still supported for now, but you should update as it may be removed in the future.
  - API CHANGE: Replace device enumeration APIs. mal_enumerate_devices() has been replaced with
    mal_context_get_devices(). An additional low-level device enumration API has been introduced called
    mal_context_enumerate_devices() which uses a callback to report devices.
  - API CHANGE: Rename mal_get_sample_size_in_bytes() to mal_get_bytes_per_sample() and add
    mal_get_bytes_per_frame().
  - API CHANGE: Replace mal_device_config.preferExclusiveMode with ma_device_config.shareMode.
    - This new config can be set to mal_share_mode_shared (default) or ma_share_mode_exclusive.
  - API CHANGE: Remove excludeNullDevice from mal_context_config.alsa.
  - API CHANGE: Rename MA_MAX_SAMPLE_SIZE_IN_BYTES to MA_MAX_PCM_SAMPLE_SIZE_IN_BYTES.
  - API CHANGE: Change the default channel mapping to the standard Microsoft mapping.
  - API CHANGE: Remove backend-specific result codes.
  - API CHANGE: Changes to the format conversion APIs (mal_pcm_f32_to_s16(), etc.)
  - Add support for Core Audio (Apple).
  - Add support for PulseAudio.
    - This is the highest priority backend on Linux (higher priority than ALSA) since it is commonly
      installed by default on many of the popular distros and offer's more seamless integration on
      platforms where PulseAudio is used. In addition, if PulseAudio is installed and running (which
      is extremely common), it's better to just use PulseAudio directly rather than going through the
      "pulse" ALSA plugin (which is what the "default" ALSA device is likely set to).
  - Add support for JACK.
  - Remove dependency on asound.h for the ALSA backend. This means the ALSA development packages are no
    longer required to build miniaudio.
  - Remove dependency on dsound.h for the DirectSound backend. This fixes build issues with some
    distributions of MinGW.
  - Remove dependency on audioclient.h for the WASAPI backend. This fixes build issues with some
    distributions of MinGW.
  - Add support for dithering to format conversion.
  - Add support for configuring the priority of the worker thread.
  - Add a sine wave generator.
  - Improve efficiency of sample rate conversion.
  - Introduce the notion of standard channel maps. Use mal_get_standard_channel_map().
  - Introduce the notion of default device configurations. A default config uses the same configuration
    as the backend's internal device, and as such results in a pass-through data transmission pipeline.
  - Add support for passing in NULL for the device config in mal_device_init(), which uses a default
    config. This requires manually calling mal_device_set_send/recv_callback().
  - Add support for decoding from raw PCM data (mal_decoder_init_raw(), etc.)
  - Make mal_device_init_ex() more robust.
  - Make some APIs more const-correct.
  - Fix errors with SDL detection on Apple platforms.
  - Fix errors with OpenAL detection.
  - Fix some memory leaks.
  - Fix a bug with opening decoders from memory.
  - Early work on SSE2, AVX2 and NEON optimizations.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.
  - Documentation updates.

v0.7 - 2018-02-25
  - API CHANGE: Change mal_src_read_frames() and mal_dsp_read_frames() to use 64-bit sample counts.
  - Add decoder APIs for loading WAV, FLAC, Vorbis and MP3 files.
  - Allow opening of devices without a context.
    - In this case the context is created and managed internally by the device.
  - Change the default channel mapping to the same as that used by FLAC.
  - Fix build errors with macOS.

v0.6c - 2018-02-12
  - Fix build errors with BSD/OSS.

v0.6b - 2018-02-03
  - Fix some warnings when compiling with Visual C++.

v0.6a - 2018-01-26
  - Fix errors with channel mixing when increasing the channel count.
  - Improvements to the build system for the OpenAL backend.
  - Documentation fixes.

v0.6 - 2017-12-08
  - API CHANGE: Expose and improve mutex APIs. If you were using the mutex APIs before this version you'll
    need to update.
  - API CHANGE: SRC and DSP callbacks now take a pointer to a mal_src and ma_dsp object respectively.
  - API CHANGE: Improvements to event and thread APIs. These changes make these APIs more consistent.
  - Add support for SDL and Emscripten.
  - Simplify the build system further for when development packages for various backends are not installed.
    With this change, when the compiler supports __has_include, backends without the relevant development
    packages installed will be ignored. This fixes the build for old versions of MinGW.
  - Fixes to the Android build.
  - Add mal_convert_frames(). This is a high-level helper API for performing a one-time, bulk conversion of
    audio data to a different format.
  - Improvements to f32 -> u8/s16/s24/s32 conversion routines.
  - Fix a bug where the wrong value is returned from mal_device_start() for the OpenSL backend.
  - Fixes and improvements for Raspberry Pi.
  - Warning fixes.

v0.5 - 2017-11-11
  - API CHANGE: The mal_context_init() function now takes a pointer to a ma_context_config object for
    configuring the context. The works in the same kind of way as the device config. The rationale for this
    change is to give applications better control over context-level properties, add support for backend-
    specific configurations, and support extensibility without breaking the API.
  - API CHANGE: The alsa.preferPlugHW device config variable has been removed since it's not really useful for
    anything anymore.
  - ALSA: By default, device enumeration will now only enumerate over unique card/device pairs. Applications
    can enable verbose device enumeration by setting the alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration context config
    variable.
  - ALSA: When opening a device in shared mode (the default), the dmix/dsnoop plugin will be prioritized. If
    this fails it will fall back to the hw plugin. With this change the preferExclusiveMode config is now
    honored. Note that this does not happen when alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration is set to true (see above)
    which is by design.
  - ALSA: Add support for excluding the "null" device using the alsa.excludeNullDevice context config variable.
  - ALSA: Fix a bug with channel mapping which causes an assertion to fail.
  - Fix errors with enumeration when pInfo is set to NULL.
  - OSS: Fix a bug when starting a device when the client sends 0 samples for the initial buffer fill.

v0.4 - 2017-11-05
  - API CHANGE: The log callback is now per-context rather than per-device and as is thus now passed to
    mal_context_init(). The rationale for this change is that it allows applications to capture diagnostic
    messages at the context level. Previously this was only available at the device level.
  - API CHANGE: The device config passed to mal_device_init() is now const.
  - Added support for OSS which enables support on BSD platforms.
  - Added support for WinMM (waveOut/waveIn).
  - Added support for UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications. Currently C++ only.
  - Added support for exclusive mode for selected backends. Currently supported on WASAPI.
  - POSIX builds no longer require explicit linking to libpthread (-lpthread).
  - ALSA: Explicit linking to libasound (-lasound) is no longer required.
  - ALSA: Latency improvements.
  - ALSA: Use MMAP mode where available. This can be disabled with the alsa.noMMap config.
  - ALSA: Use "hw" devices instead of "plughw" devices by default. This can be disabled with the
    alsa.preferPlugHW config.
  - WASAPI is now the highest priority backend on Windows platforms.
  - Fixed an error with sample rate conversion which was causing crackling when capturing.
  - Improved error handling.
  - Improved compiler support.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

v0.3 - 2017-06-19
  - API CHANGE: Introduced the notion of a context. The context is the highest level object and is required for
    enumerating and creating devices. Now, applications must first create a context, and then use that to
    enumerate and create devices. The reason for this change is to ensure device enumeration and creation is
    tied to the same backend. In addition, some backends are better suited to this design.
  - API CHANGE: Removed the rewinding APIs because they're too inconsistent across the different backends, hard
    to test and maintain, and just generally unreliable.
  - Added helper APIs for initializing mal_device_config objects.
  - Null Backend: Fixed a crash when recording.
  - Fixed build for UWP.
  - Added support for f32 formats to the OpenSL|ES backend.
  - Added initial implementation of the WASAPI backend.
  - Added initial implementation of the OpenAL backend.
  - Added support for low quality linear sample rate conversion.
  - Added early support for basic channel mapping.

v0.2 - 2016-10-28
  - API CHANGE: Add user data pointer as the last parameter to mal_device_init(). The rationale for this
    change is to ensure the logging callback has access to the user data during initialization.
  - API CHANGE: Have device configuration properties be passed to mal_device_init() via a structure. Rationale:
    1) The number of parameters is just getting too much.
    2) It makes it a bit easier to add new configuration properties in the future. In particular, there's a
       chance there will be support added for backend-specific properties.
  - Dropped support for f64, A-law and Mu-law formats since they just aren't common enough to justify the
    added maintenance cost.
  - DirectSound: Increased the default buffer size for capture devices.
  - Added initial implementation of the OpenSL|ES backend.

v0.1 - 2016-10-21
  - Initial versioned release.
