-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release:     raylib 4.0 - 8th Anniversary Edition (05 November 2021)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY CHANGES:
 - Naming consistency and coherency: Complete review of the library: syntax, naming, comments, decriptions, logs...

 - Custom game-loop control: Intended for advanced users that want to control the events polling and the timming mechanisms
 - rlgl 4.0: Completely decoupling from platform layer and raylib, intended for standalone usage as single-file header-only
 - raymath 1.5: Complete review following new conventions, to make it more portable and self-contained
 - raygui 3.0: Complete review and official new release, more portable and self-contained, intended for tools development
 - raylib_parser: New tool to parse raylib.h and extract all required info into custom output formats (TXT, XML, JSON...)
 - Zig and Odin official support

[textures] REVIEWED: ExportImage() to use SaveFileData() (#1779)
[textures] REVIEWED: LoadImageAnim() #2005
[text] ADDED: Security check in case of not valid font
[text] ADDED: `GetGlyphInfo()` to get glyph info for a specific codepoint
[text] ADDED: `GetGlyphAtlasRec()` to get glyph rectangle within the generated font atlas
[text] ADDED: DrawTextPro() with text rotation support, WARNING: DrawTextPro() requires including `rlgl.h`, before it was only dependant on `textures` module.
[text] ADDED: UnloadCodepoints() to safely free loaded codepoints
[text] REMOVED: DrawTextRec() and DrawTextRecEx(), moved to example, those functions could be very specific depending on user needs so it's better to give the user the full source in case of special requirements instead of allowing a function with +10 input parameters.
[text] RENAMED: struct `CharInfo` to `GlyphInfo`, actually that's the correct naming for the data contained. It contains the character glyph metrics and the glyph image; in the past it also contained rectangle within the font atlas but that data has been moved to `Font` struct directly, so, `GlyphInfo` is a more correct name.
[text] RENAMED: `CodepointToUtf8()` to `CodepointToUTF8()`, capitalization of UTF-8 is the correct form, it would also require de hyphen but it can be omitted in this case.
[text] RENAMED: `TextToUtf8()` to `TextCodepointsToUTF8` for consistency and more detail on the functionality.
[text] RENAMED: GetCodepoints() to LoadCodepoints(), now codepoint array data is loaded dynamically instead of reusing a limited static buffer.
[text] RENAMED: GetNextCodepoint() to GetCodepoint()
